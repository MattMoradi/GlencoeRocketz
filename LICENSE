Copyright Act of 1976 and all subsequent amendments to copyright law; the
Semiconductor Chip Protection Act of 1984, as amended; and the Vessel Hull

intellectual property claims under all three.
The United States copyright law is contained in chapters 1 through 8 and
10 through 12 of title 17 of the United States Code. The Copyright Act of 1976,
which provides the basic framework for the current copyright law, was enacted
on October 19, 1976, as Pub. L. No. 94-553, 90 Stat. 2541. The 1976 Act was a
comprehensive revision of the copyright law in title 17. Listed below in chronological
order of their enactment are the Copyright Act of 1976 and subsequent
amendments to title 17.
Chapters 9 and 13 of title 17 contain two types of design protection that are
independent of copyright protection. Chapter 9 of title 17 is the Semiconductor
Chip Protection Act of 1984 (SCPA), as amended. The SCPA was enacted as title

of title 17 is the Vessel Hull Design Protection Act (VHDPA), as amended. The

Copyright Act (DMCA), Pub. L. No. 105-304, 112 Stat. 2860, 2905. Subsequent
amendments to the title 17 provisions for SCPA and the VHDPA are also included

Except as otherwise provided in this title, as used in this title, the following terms
and their variant forms mean the following:
An “anonymous work” is a work on the copies or phonorecords of which no
natural person is identified as author.
An “architectural work” is the design of a building as embodied in any tangible
medium of expression, including a building, architectural plans, or drawings. The
work includes the overall form as well as the arrangement and composition of spaces
and elements in the design, but does not include individual standard features.3
“Audiovisual works” are works that consist of a series of related images which
are intrinsically intended to be shown by the use of machines or devices such as
projectors, viewers, or electronic equipment, together with accompanying sounds,
if any, regardless of the nature of the material objects, such as films or tapes, in
which the works are embodied.
The “Berne Convention” is the Convention for the Protection of Literary and
Artistic Works, signed at Berne, Switzerland, on September 9, 1886, and all acts,
protocols, and revisions thereto.4
The “best edition” of a work is the edition, published in the United States at
any time before the date of deposit, that the Library of Congress determines to
be most suitable for its purposes.
A person’s “children” are that person’s immediate offspring, whether legitimate
or not, and any children legally adopted by that person.
A “collective work” is a work, such as a periodical issue, anthology, or encyclopedia,
in which a number of contributions, constituting separate and independent
works in themselves, are assembled into a collective whole.
A “compilation” is a work formed by the collection and assembling of preexisting
materials or of data that are selected, coordinated, or arranged in such a way
that the resulting work as a whole constitutes an original work of authorship. The
term “compilation” includes collective works.
A “computer program” is a set of statements or instructions to be used directly
or indirectly in a computer in order to bring about a certain result.5
“Copies” are material objects, other than phonorecords, in which a work is
fixed by any method now known or later developed, and from which the work
can be perceived, reproduced, or otherwise communicated, either directly or with

A work is “created” when it is fixed in a copy or phonorecord for the first time;
where a work is prepared over a period of time, the portion of it that has been
fixed at any particular time constitutes the work as of that time, and where the
work has been prepared in different versions, each version constitutes a separate
work.
A “derivative work” is a work based upon one or more preexisting works, such
as a translation, musical arrangement, dramatization, fictionalization, motion
picture version, sound recording, art reproduction, abridgment, condensation, or
any other form in which a work may be recast, transformed, or adapted. A work
consisting of editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications,
which, as a whole, represent an original work of authorship, is a “derivative
work”.

that purpose, and in which nondramatic musical works are performed publicly.8
The term “financial gain” includes receipt, or expectation of receipt, of anything
of value, including the receipt of other copyrighted works.9
A work is “fixed” in a tangible medium of expression when its embodiment
in a copy or phonorecord, by or under the authority of the author, is sufficiently
permanent or stable to permit it to be perceived, reproduced, or otherwise communicated

sounds, images, or both, that are being transmitted, is “fixed” for purposes of this
title if a fixation of the work is being made simultaneously with its transmission.
A “food service or drinking establishment” is a restaurant, inn, bar, tavern, or
any other similar place of business in which the public or patrons assemble for
the primary purpose of being served food or drink, in which the majority of the
gross square feet of space that is nonresidential is used for that purpose, and in
which nondramatic musical works are performed publicly.10

of the Intellectual Property and Communications Omnibus Reform Act of 1999,
as enacted by section 1000(a)(9) of Public Law 106-113, nor the deletion of the
words added by that amendment—
(A) shall be considered or otherwise given any legal significance, or
(B) shall be interpreted to indicate congressional approval or disapproval
of, or acquiescence in, any judicial determination,
by the courts or the Copyright Office. Paragraph (2) shall be interpreted as if
both section 2(a)(1) of the Work Made for Hire and Copyright Corrections Act
of 2000 and section 1011(d) of the Intellectual Property and Communications
Omnibus Reform Act of 1999, as enacted by section 1000(a)(9) of Public Law

illustrated, or embodied in such work.
Copyright Law of the United States 9
Subject Matter and Scope of Copyright §104
§103 · Subject matter of copyright:
Compilations and derivative works
(a) The subject matter of copyright as specified by section 102 includes compilations
and derivative works, but protection for a work employing preexisting
material in which copyright subsists does not extend to any part of the work in
which such material has been used unlawfully.
(b) The copyright in a compilation or derivative work extends only to the
material contributed by the author of such work, as distinguished from the preexisting
material employed in the work, and does not imply any exclusive right
in the preexisting material. The copyright in such work is independent of, and
does not affect or enlarge the scope, duration, ownership, or subsistence of, any
copyright protection in the preexisting material.
§104 · Subject matter of copyright: National origin29
(a) Unpublished Works.—The works specified by sections 102 and 103,
while unpublished, are subject to protection under this title without regard to
the nationality or domicile of the author.
(b) Published Works.—The works specified by sections 102 and 103, when
published, are subject to protection under this title if—
(1) on the date of first publication, one or more of the authors is a national
or domiciliary of the United States, or is a national, domiciliary, or sovereign
authority of a treaty party, or is a stateless person, wherever that person may
be domiciled; or
(2) the work is first published in the United States or in a foreign nation that,
on the date of first publication, is a treaty party; or
(3) the work is a sound recording that was first fixed in a treaty party; or
(4) the work is a pictorial, graphic, or sculptural work that is incorporated
in a building or other structure, or an architectural work that is embodied in
a building and the building or structure is located in the United States or a
treaty party; or
(5) the work is first published by the United Nations or any of its specialized
agencies, or by the Organization of American States; or
(6) the work comes within the scope of a Presidential proclamation. Whenever
the President finds that a particular foreign nation extends, to works by authors
who are nationals or domiciliaries of the United States or to works that are first
published in the United States, copyright protection on substantially the same
basis as that on which the foreign nation extends protection to works of its own
nationals and domiciliaries and works first published in that nation, the President
may by proclamation extend protection under this title to works of which 
10 Copyright Law of the United States
§104a Subject Matter and Scope of Copyright
one or more of the authors is, on the date of first publication, a national, domiciliary,
or sovereign authority of that nation, or which was first published in that
nation. The President may revise, suspend, or revoke any such proclamation or
impose any conditions or limitations on protection under a proclamation.
For purposes of paragraph (2), a work that is published in the United States
or a treaty party within 30 days after publication in a foreign nation that is not a
treaty party shall be considered to be first published in the United States or such
treaty party, as the case may be.
(c) Effect of Berne Convention.—No right or interest in a work eligible
for protection under this title may be claimed by virtue of, or in reliance upon, the
provisions of the Berne Convention, or the adherence of the United States thereto.
Any rights in a work eligible for protection under this title that derive from this
title, other Federal or State statutes, or the common law, shall not be expanded or
reduced by virtue of, or in reliance upon, the provisions of the Berne Convention,
or the adherence of the United States thereto.
(d) Effect of Phonograms Treaties.—Notwithstanding the provisions
of subsection (b), no works other than sound recordings shall be eligible for
protection under this title solely by virtue of the adherence of the United States
to the Geneva Phonograms Convention or the WIPO Performances and Phonograms
Treaty.30
§104a · Copyright in restored works31
(a) Automatic Protection and Term.—
(1) Term.—
(A) Copyright subsists, in accordance with this section, in restored works,
and vests automatically on the date of restoration.
(B) Any work in which copyright is restored under this section shall
subsist for the remainder of the term of copyright that the work would have
otherwise been granted in the United States if the work never entered the
public domain in the United States.
(2) Exception.—Any work in which the copyright was ever owned or
administered by the Alien Property Custodian and in which the restored copyright
would be owned by a government or instrumentality thereof, is not a
restored work.
(b) Ownership of Restored Copyright.—A restored work vests initially
in the author or initial rightholder of the work as determined by the law of the
source country of the work.
(c) Filing of Notice of Intent to Enforce Restored Copyright
Against Reliance Parties.—On or after the date of restoration, any person
who owns a copyright in a restored work or an exclusive right therein may file 
Copyright Law of the United States 11
Subject Matter and Scope of Copyright §104a
with the Copyright Office a notice of intent to enforce that person’s copyright or
exclusive right or may serve such a notice directly on a reliance party. Acceptance
of a notice by the Copyright Office is effective as to any reliance parties but shall
not create a presumption of the validity of any of the facts stated therein. Service
on a reliance party is effective as to that reliance party and any other reliance
parties with actual knowledge of such service and of the contents of that notice.
(d) Remedies for Infringement of Restored Copyrights.—
(1) Enforcement of copyright in restored works in the absence
of a reliance party.—As against any party who is not a reliance party, the
remedies provided in chapter 5 of this title shall be available on or after the
date of restoration of a restored copyright with respect to an act of infringement
of the restored copyright that is commenced on or after the date of
restoration.
(2) Enforcement of copyright in restored works as against reliance
parties.—As against a reliance party, except to the extent provided
in paragraphs (3) and (4), the remedies provided in chapter 5 of this title shall
be available, with respect to an act of infringement of a restored copyright, on
or after the date of restoration of the restored copyright if the requirements
of either of the following subparagraphs are met:
(A)(i) The owner of the restored copyright (or such owner’s agent) or the
owner of an exclusive right therein (or such owner’s agent) files with the
Copyright Office, during the 24-month period beginning on the date of
restoration, a notice of intent to enforce the restored copyright; and
(ii)(I) the act of infringement commenced after the end of the 12-
month period beginning on the date of publication of the notice in the
Federal Register;
(II) the act of infringement commenced before the end of the
12-month period described in subclause (I) and continued after the
end of that 12-month period, in which case remedies shall be available
only for infringement occurring after the end of that 12-month
period; or
(III) copies or phonorecords of a work in which copyright has
been restored under this section are made after publication of the
notice of intent in the Federal Register.
(B)(i) The owner of the restored copyright (or such owner’s agent) or the
owner of an exclusive right therein (or such owner’s agent) serves upon a
reliance party a notice of intent to enforce a restored copyright; and
(ii)(I) the act of infringement commenced after the end of the 12-
month period beginning on the date the notice of intent is received;
(II) the act of infringement commenced before the end of the 12-
month period described in subclause (I) and continued after the end
of that 12-month period, in which case remedies shall be available 
12 Copyright Law of the United States
§104a Subject Matter and Scope of Copyright
only for the infringement occurring after the end of that 12-month
period; or
(III) copies or phonorecords of a work in which copyright has
been restored under this section are made after receipt of the notice
of intent.
In the event that notice is provided under both subparagraphs (A) and (B), the
12-month period referred to in such subparagraphs shall run from the earlier of
publication or service of notice.
(3) Existing derivative works.—
(A) In the case of a derivative work that is based upon a restored work
and is created—
(i) before the date of the enactment of the Uruguay Round Agreements
Act, if the source country of the restored work is an eligible country
on such date, or
(ii) before the date on which the source country of the restored work
becomes an eligible country, if that country is not an eligible country
on such date of enactment,
a reliance party may continue to exploit that derivative work for the
duration of the restored copyright if the reliance party pays to the owner
of the restored copyright reasonable compensation for conduct which
would be subject to a remedy for infringement but for the provisions of
this paragraph.
(B) In the absence of an agreement between the parties, the amount of
such compensation shall be determined by an action in United States district
court, and shall reflect any harm to the actual or potential market for
or value of the restored work from the reliance party’s continued exploitation
of the work, as well as compensation for the relative contributions of
expression of the author of the restored work and the reliance party to the
derivative work.
(4) Commencement of infringement for reliance parties.—For
purposes of section 412, in the case of reliance parties, infringement shall be
deemed to have commenced before registration when acts which would have
constituted infringement had the restored work been subject to copyright were
commenced before the date of restoration.
(e) Notices of Intent to Enforce a Restored Copyright.—
(1) Notices of intent filed with the Copyright Office.—
(A)(i) A notice of intent filed with the Copyright Office to enforce a restored
copyright shall be signed by the owner of the restored copyright or
the owner of an exclusive right therein, who files the notice under subsection
(d)(2)(A)(i) (hereafter in this paragraph referred to as the “owner”), or
by the owner’s agent, shall identify the title of the restored work, and shall
include an English translation of the title and any other alternative titles 
Copyright Law of the United States 13
Subject Matter and Scope of Copyright §104a
known to the owner by which the restored work may be identified, and an
address and telephone number at which the owner may be contacted. If the
notice is signed by an agent, the agency relationship must have been constituted
in a writing signed by the owner before the filing of the notice. The
Copyright Office may specifically require in regulations other information
to be included in the notice, but failure to provide such other information
shall not invalidate the notice or be a basis for refusal to list the restored
work in the Federal Register.
(ii) If a work in which copyright is restored has no formal title, it shall
be described in the notice of intent in detail sufficient to identify it.
(iii) Minor errors or omissions may be corrected by further notice at
any time after the notice of intent is filed. Notices of corrections for such
minor errors or omissions shall be accepted after the period established
in subsection (d)(2)(A)(i). Notices shall be published in the Federal Register
pursuant to subparagraph (B).
(B)(i) The Register of Copyrights shall publish in the Federal Register,
commencing not later than 4 months after the date of restoration for a
particular nation and every 4 months thereafter for a period of 2 years, lists
identifying restored works and the ownership thereof if a notice of intent
to enforce a restored copyright has been filed.
(ii) Not less than 1 list containing all notices of intent to enforce shall
be maintained in the Public Information Office of the Copyright Office
and shall be available for public inspection and copying during regular
business hours pursuant to sections 705 and 708.
(C) The Register of Copyrights is authorized to fix reasonable fees based
on the costs of receipt, processing, recording, and publication of notices of
intent to enforce a restored copyright and corrections thereto.
(D)(i) Not later than 90 days before the date the Agreement on TradeRelated
Aspects of Intellectual Property referred to in section 101(d)(15) of
the Uruguay Round Agreements Act enters into force with respect to the
United States, the Copyright Office shall issue and publish in the Federal
Register regulations governing the filing under this subsection of notices of
intent to enforce a restored copyright.
(ii) Such regulations shall permit owners of restored copyrights to file
simultaneously for registration of the restored copyright.
(2) Notices of intent served on a reliance party.—
(A) Notices of intent to enforce a restored copyright may be served on
a reliance party at any time after the date of restoration of the restored
copyright.
(B) Notices of intent to enforce a restored copyright served on a reliance
party shall be signed by the owner or the owner’s agent, shall identify the
restored work and the work in which the restored work is used, if any, in 
14 Copyright Law of the United States
§104a Subject Matter and Scope of Copyright
detail sufficient to identify them, and shall include an English translation of
the title, any other alternative titles known to the owner by which the work
may be identified, the use or uses to which the owner objects, and an address
and telephone number at which the reliance party may contact the owner.
If the notice is signed by an agent, the agency relationship must have been
constituted in writing and signed by the owner before service of the notice.
(3) Effect of material false statements.—Any material false statement
knowingly made with respect to any restored copyright identified in any
notice of intent shall make void all claims and assertions made with respect
to such restored copyright.
(f) Immunity from Warranty and Related Liability.—
(1) In general.—Any person who warrants, promises, or guarantees that
a work does not violate an exclusive right granted in section 106 shall not
be liable for legal, equitable, arbitral, or administrative relief if the warranty,
promise, or guarantee is breached by virtue of the restoration of copyright
under this section, if such warranty, promise, or guarantee is made before
January 1, 1995.
(2) Performances.—No person shall be required to perform any act if
such performance is made infringing by virtue of the restoration of copyright
under the provisions of this section, if the obligation to perform was undertaken
before January 1, 1995.
(g) Proclamation of Copyright Restoration.—Whenever the President
finds that a particular foreign nation extends, to works by authors who are
nationals or domiciliaries of the United States, restored copyright protection on
substantially the same basis as provided under this section, the President may

independent of the exclusive rights provided in section 106, the author of a work
of visual art—
(1) shall have the right—
(A) to claim authorship of that work, and
(B) to prevent the use of his or her name as the author of any work of
visual art which he or she did not create;
(2) shall have the right to prevent the use of his or her name as the author
of the work of visual art in the event of a distortion, mutilation, or other
modification of the work which would be prejudicial to his or her honor or
reputation; and
(3) subject to the limitations set forth in section 113(d), shall have the right—
(A) to prevent any intentional distortion, mutilation, or other modification
of that work which would be prejudicial to his or her honor or reputation,
and any intentional distortion, mutilation, or modification of that
work is a violation of that right, and
(B) to prevent any destruction of a work of recognized stature, and any
intentional or grossly negligent destruction of that work is a violation of
that right.
(b) Scope and Exercise of Rights.—Only the author of a work of visual
art has the rights conferred by subsection (a) in that work, whether or not the
author is the copyright owner. The authors of a joint work of visual art are
coowners of the rights conferred by subsection (a) in that work.
18 Copyright Law of the United States
§106a Subject Matter and Scope of Copyright
(c) Exceptions.—(1) The modification of a work of visual art which is the
result of the passage of time or the inherent nature of the materials is not a distortion,
mutilation, or other modification described in subsection (a)(3)(A).
(2) The modification of a work of visual art which is the result of conservation,
or of the public presentation, including lighting and placement, of the work
is not a destruction, distortion, mutilation, or other modification described in
subsection (a)(3) unless the modification is caused by gross negligence.
(3) The rights described in paragraphs (1) and (2) of subsection (a) shall
not apply to any reproduction, depiction, portrayal, or other use of a work
in, upon, or in any connection with any item described in subparagraph (A)
or (B) of the definition of “work of visual art” in section 101, and any such
reproduction, depiction, portrayal, or other use of a work is not a destruction,
distortion, mutilation, or other modification described in paragraph (3) of
subsection (a).
(d) Duration of Rights.—(1) With respect to works of visual art created on
or after the effective date set forth in section 610(a) of the Visual Artists Rights Act
of 1990, the rights conferred by subsection (a) shall endure for a term consisting
of the life of the author.
(2) With respect to works of visual art created before the effective date set
forth in section 610(a) of the Visual Artists Rights Act of 1990, but title to
which has not, as of such effective date, been transferred from the author, the
rights conferred by subsection (a) shall be coextensive with, and shall expire at
the same time as, the rights conferred by section 106.
(3) In the case of a joint work prepared by two or more authors, the rights
conferred by subsection (a) shall endure for a term consisting of the life of the
last surviving author.
(4) All terms of the rights conferred by subsection (a) run to the end of the
calendar year in which they would otherwise expire.
(e) Transfer and Waiver.—(1) The rights conferred by subsection (a) may
not be transferred, but those rights may be waived if the author expressly agrees
to such waiver in a written instrument signed by the author. Such instrument
shall specifically identify the work, and uses of that work, to which the waiver
applies, and the waiver shall apply only to the work and uses so identified. In the
case of a joint work prepared by two or more authors, a waiver of rights under
this paragraph made by one such author waives such rights for all such authors.
(2) Ownership of the rights conferred by subsection (a) with respect to a
work of visual art is distinct from ownership of any copy of that work, or of
a copyright or any exclusive right under a copyright in that work. Transfer
of ownership of any copy of a work of visual art, or of a copyright or any
exclusive right under a copyright, shall not constitute a waiver of the rights
conferred by subsection (a). Except as may otherwise be agreed by the author
in a written instrument signed by the author, a waiver of the rights conferred 
Copyright Law of the United States 19
Subject Matter and Scope of Copyright §108
by subsection (a) with respect to a work of visual art shall not constitute a
transfer of ownership of any copy of that work, or of ownership of a copyright
or of any exclusive right under a copyright in that work.
§107 · Limitations on exclusive rights: Fair use40
Notwithstanding the provisions of sections 106 and 106A, the fair use of a
copyrighted work, including such use by reproduction in copies or phonorecords
or by any other means specified by that section, for purposes such as criticism,
comment, news reporting, teaching (including multiple copies for classroom use),
scholarship, or research, is not an infringement of copyright. In determining
whether the use made of a work in any particular case is a fair use the factors to
be considered shall include—
(1) the purpose and character of the use, including whether such use is of a
commercial nature or is for nonprofit educational purposes;
(2) the nature of the copyrighted work;
(3) the amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted
work as a whole; and
(4) the effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted
work.
The fact that a work is unpublished shall not itself bar a finding of fair use if
such finding is made upon consideration of all the above factors.
§108 · Limitations on exclusive rights:
Reproduction by libraries and archives41
(a) Except as otherwise provided in this title and notwithstanding the provisions
of section 106, it is not an infringement of copyright for a library or archives,
or any of its employees acting within the scope of their employment, to reproduce
no more than one copy or phonorecord of a work, except as provided in subsections
(b) and (c), or to distribute such copy or phonorecord, under the conditions
specified by this section, if—
(1) the reproduction or distribution is made without any purpose of direct
or indirect commercial advantage;
(2) the collections of the library or archives are (i) open to the public, or (ii)
available not only to researchers affiliated with the library or archives or with
the institution of which it is a part, but also to other persons doing research
in a specialized field; and
(3) the reproduction or distribution of the work includes a notice of copyright
that appears on the copy or phonorecord that is reproduced under the 
20 Copyright Law of the United States
§108 Subject Matter and Scope of Copyright
provisions of this section, or includes a legend stating that the work may be
protected by copyright if no such notice can be found on the copy or phonorecord
that is reproduced under the provisions of this section.
(b) The rights of reproduction and distribution under this section apply to
three copies or phonorecords of an unpublished work duplicated solely for purposes
of preservation and security or for deposit for research use in another library
or archives of the type described by clause (2) of subsection (a), if—
(1) the copy or phonorecord reproduced is currently in the collections of
the library or archives; and
(2) any such copy or phonorecord that is reproduced in digital format is not
otherwise distributed in that format and is not made available to the public in
that format outside the premises of the library or archives.
(c) The right of reproduction under this section applies to three copies or phonorecords
of a published work duplicated solely for the purpose of replacement
of a copy or phonorecord that is damaged, deteriorating, lost, or stolen, or if the
existing format in which the work is stored has become obsolete, if—
(1) the library or archives has, after a reasonable effort, determined that an
unused replacement cannot be obtained at a fair price; and
(2) any such copy or phonorecord that is reproduced in digital format is not
made available to the public in that format outside the premises of the library
or archives in lawful possession of such copy.
For purposes of this subsection, a format shall be considered obsolete if the
machine or device necessary to render perceptible a work stored in that format
is no longer manufactured or is no longer reasonably available in the commercial
marketplace.
(d) The rights of reproduction and distribution under this section apply to a
copy, made from the collection of a library or archives where the user makes his
or her request or from that of another library or archives, of no more than one
article or other contribution to a copyrighted collection or periodical issue, or to
a copy or phonorecord of a small part of any other copyrighted work, if—
(1) the copy or phonorecord becomes the property of the user, and the
library or archives has had no notice that the copy or phonorecord would be
used for any purpose other than private study, scholarship, or research; and
(2) the library or archives displays prominently, at the place where orders are
accepted, and includes on its order form, a warning of copyright in accordance
with requirements that the Register of Copyrights shall prescribe by regulation.
(e) The rights of reproduction and distribution under this section apply to the
entire work, or to a substantial part of it, made from the collection of a library or
archives where the user makes his or her request or from that of another library
or archives, if the library or archives has first determined, on the basis of a reasonable
investigation, that a copy or phonorecord of the copyrighted work cannot
be obtained at a fair price, if—
Copyright Law of the United States 21
Subject Matter and Scope of Copyright §108
(1) the copy or phonorecord becomes the property of the user, and the
library or archives has had no notice that the copy or phonorecord would be
used for any purpose other than private study, scholarship, or research; and
(2) the library or archives displays prominently, at the place where orders
are accepted, and includes on its order form, a warning of copyright in accordance
with requirements that the Register of Copyrights shall prescribe
by regulation.
(f) Nothing in this section—
(1) shall be construed to impose liability for copyright infringement upon
a library or archives or its employees for the unsupervised use of reproducing
equipment located on its premises: Provided, That such equipment displays a
notice that the making of a copy may be subject to the copyright law;
(2) excuses a person who uses such reproducing equipment or who requests
a copy or phonorecord under subsection (d) from liability for copyright infringement
for any such act, or for any later use of such copy or phonorecord,
if it exceeds fair use as provided by section 107;
(3) shall be construed to limit the reproduction and distribution by lending
of a limited number of copies and excerpts by a library or archives of an audiovisual
news program, subject to clauses (1), (2), and (3) of subsection (a); or
(4) in any way affects the right of fair use as provided by section 107, or any
contractual obligations assumed at any time by the library or archives when it
obtained a copy or phonorecord of a work in its collections.
(g) The rights of reproduction and distribution under this section extend to
the isolated and unrelated reproduction or distribution of a single copy or phonorecord
of the same material on separate occasions, but do not extend to cases
where the library or archives, or its employee—
(1) is aware or has substantial reason to believe that it is engaging in the
related or concerted reproduction or distribution of multiple copies or phonorecords
of the same material, whether made on one occasion or over a period
of time, and whether intended for aggregate use by one or more individuals
or for separate use by the individual members of a group; or
(2) engages in the systematic reproduction or distribution of single or multiple
copies or phonorecords of material described in subsection (d): Provided,
That nothing in this clause prevents a library or archives from participating
in interlibrary arrangements that do not have, as their purpose or effect, that
the library or archives receiving such copies or phonorecords for distribution
does so in such aggregate quantities as to substitute for a subscription to or
purchase of such work.
(h)(1) For purposes of this section, during the last 20 years of any term of copyright
of a published work, a library or archives, including a nonprofit educational
institution that functions as such, may reproduce, distribute, display, or perform in
facsimile or digital form a copy or phonorecord of such work, or portions thereof, 
§109
22 Copyright Law of the United States
Subject Matter and Scope of Copyright
for purposes of preservation, scholarship, or research, if such library or archives
has first determined, on the basis of a reasonable investigation, that none of the
conditions set forth in subparagraphs (A), (B), and (C) of paragraph (2) apply.
(2) No reproduction, distribution, display, or performance is authorized
under this subsection if—
(A) the work is subject to normal commercial exploitation;
(B) a copy or phonorecord of the work can be obtained at a reasonable
price; or
(C) the copyright owner or its agent provides notice pursuant to regulations
promulgated by the Register of Copyrights that either of the conditions
set forth in subparagraphs (A) and (B) applies.
(3) The exemption provided in this subsection does not apply to any subsequent
uses by users other than such library or archives.
(i) The rights of reproduction and distribution under this section do not apply
to a musical work, a pictorial, graphic or sculptural work, or a motion picture or
other audiovisual work other than an audiovisual work dealing with news, except
that no such limitation shall apply with respect to rights granted by subsections
(b), (c), and (h), or with respect to pictorial or graphic works published as illustrations,
diagrams, or similar adjuncts to works of which copies are reproduced or
distributed in accordance with subsections (d) and (e).
§109 · Limitations on exclusive rights:
Effect of transfer of particular copy or phonorecord42
(a) Notwithstanding the provisions of section 106(3), the owner of a particular
copy or phonorecord lawfully made under this title, or any person authorized by
such owner, is entitled, without the authority of the copyright owner, to sell or
otherwise dispose of the possession of that copy or phonorecord. Notwithstanding
the preceding sentence, copies or phonorecords of works subject to restored
copyright under section 104A that are manufactured before the date of restoration
of copyright or, with respect to reliance parties, before publication or service
of notice under section 104A(e), may be sold or otherwise disposed of without
the authorization of the owner of the restored copyright for purposes of direct or
indirect commercial advantage only during the 12-month period beginning on—
(1) the date of the publication in the Federal Register of the notice of intent
filed with the Copyright Office under section 104A(d)(2)(A), or
(2) the date of the receipt of actual notice served under section 104A(d)(2)
(B), whichever occurs first.
(b)(1)(A) Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (a), unless authorized
by the owners of copyright in the sound recording or the owner of copyright in a
computer program (including any tape, disk, or other medium embodying such 
Copyright Law of the United States 23
Subject Matter and Scope of Copyright §109
program), and in the case of a sound recording in the musical works embodied
therein, neither the owner of a particular phonorecord nor any person in possession
of a particular copy of a computer program (including any tape, disk,
or other medium embodying such program), may, for the purposes of direct
or indirect commercial advantage, dispose of, or authorize the disposal of, the
possession of that phonorecord or computer program (including any tape, disk,
or other medium embodying such program) by rental, lease, or lending, or by
any other act or practice in the nature of rental, lease, or lending. Nothing in the
preceding sentence shall apply to the rental, lease, or lending of a phonorecord for
nonprofit purposes by a nonprofit library or nonprofit educational institution.
The transfer of possession of a lawfully made copy of a computer program by a
nonprofit educational institution to another nonprofit educational institution
or to faculty, staff, and students does not constitute rental, lease, or lending for
direct or indirect commercial purposes under this subsection.
(B) This subsection does not apply to—
(i) a computer program which is embodied in a machine or product
and which cannot be copied during the ordinary operation or use of the
machine or product; or
(ii) a computer program embodied in or used in conjunction with a
limited purpose computer that is designed for playing video games and
may be designed for other purposes.
(C) Nothing in this subsection affects any provision of chapter 9 of this
title.
(2)(A) Nothing in this subsection shall apply to the lending of a computer
program for nonprofit purposes by a nonprofit library, if each copy of a computer
program which is lent by such library has affixed to the packaging containing
the program a warning of copyright in accordance with requirements
that the Register of Copyrights shall prescribe by regulation.
(B) Not later than three years after the date of the enactment of the
Computer Software Rental Amendments Act of 1990, and at such times
thereafter as the Register of Copyrights considers appropriate, the Register
of Copyrights, after consultation with representatives of copyright owners
and librarians, shall submit to the Congress a report stating whether this
paragraph has achieved its intended purpose of maintaining the integrity
of the copyright system while providing nonprofit libraries the capability
to fulfill their function. Such report shall advise the Congress as to any
information or recommendations that the Register of Copyrights considers
necessary to carry out the purposes of this subsection.
(3) Nothing in this subsection shall affect any provision of the antitrust
laws. For purposes of the preceding sentence, “antitrust laws” has the meaning
given that term in the first section of the Clayton Act and includes section 5 of 
§110
24 Copyright Law of the United States
Subject Matter and Scope of Copyright
the Federal Trade Commission Act to the extent that section relates to unfair
methods of competition.
(4) Any person who distributes a phonorecord or a copy of a computer program

§111 · Limitations on exclusive rights: Secondary transmissions of
broadcast programming by cable44
(a) Certain Secondary Transmissions Exempted.—The secondary
transmission of a performance or display of a work embodied in a primary transmission
is not an infringement of copyright if—
(1) the secondary transmission is not made by a cable system, and consists
entirely of the relaying, by the management of a hotel, apartment house, or
similar establishment, of signals transmitted by a broadcast station licensed by
the Federal Communications Commission, within the local service area of such
station, to the private lodgings of guests or residents of such establishment, and
no direct charge is made to see or hear the secondary transmission; or
(2) the secondary transmission is made solely for the purpose and under
the conditions specified by paragraph (2) of section 110; or
(3) the secondary transmission is made by any carrier who has no direct or
indirect control over the content or selection of the primary transmission or over
the particular recipients of the secondary transmission, and whose activities with
respect to the secondary transmission consist solely of providing wires, cables, or
other communications channels for the use of others: Provided, That the provisions
of this paragraph extend only to the activities of said carrier with respect to
secondary transmissions and do not exempt from liability the activities of others
with respect to their own primary or secondary transmissions;
(4) the secondary transmission is made by a satellite carrier pursuant to a
statutory license under section 119 or section 122;
(5) the secondary transmission is not made by a cable system but is made by
a governmental body, or other nonprofit organization, without any purpose
of direct or indirect commercial advantage, and without charge to the recipients
of the secondary transmission other than assessments necessary to defray
the actual and reasonable costs of maintaining and operating the secondary
transmission service.
(b) Secondary Transmission of Primary Transmission to Controlled
Group.—Notwithstanding the provisions of subsections (a) and (c),
the secondary transmission to the public of a performance or display of a work
embodied in a primary transmission is actionable as an act of infringement
under section 501, and is fully subject to the remedies provided by sections 502
through 506, if the primary transmission is not made for reception by the public 
Copyright Law of the United States 31
Subject Matter and Scope of Copyright §111
at large but is controlled and limited to reception by particular members of the
public: Provided, however, That such secondary transmission is not actionable
as an act of infringement if—
(1) the primary transmission is made by a broadcast station licensed by the
Federal Communications Commission; and
(2) the carriage of the signals comprising the secondary transmission is
required under the rules, regulations, or authorizations of the Federal Communications
Commission; and
(3) the signal of the primary transmitter is not altered or changed in any
way by the secondary transmitter.
(c) Secondary Transmissions by Cable Systems.—
(1) Subject to the provisions of paragraphs (2), (3), and (4) of this subsection
and section 114(d), secondary transmissions to the public by a cable system
of a performance or display of a work embodied in a primary transmission
made by a broadcast station licensed by the Federal Communications Commission
or by an appropriate governmental authority of Canada or Mexico
shall be subject to statutory licensing upon compliance with the requirements
of subsection (d) where the carriage of the signals comprising the secondary
transmission is permissible under the rules, regulations, or authorizations of
the Federal Communications Commission.
(2) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (1) of this subsection, the
willful or repeated secondary transmission to the public by a cable system of
a primary transmission made by a broadcast station licensed by the Federal
Communications Commission or by an appropriate governmental authority
of Canada or Mexico and embodying a performance or display of a work is
actionable as an act of infringement under section 501, and is fully subject to
the remedies provided by sections 502 through 506, in the following cases:
(A) where the carriage of the signals comprising the secondary transmission
is not permissible under the rules, regulations, or authorizations of the
Federal Communications Commission; or
(B) where the cable system has not deposited the statement of account
and royalty fee required by subsection (d).
(3) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (1) of this subsection and
subject to the provisions of subsection (e) of this section, the secondary transmission
to the public by a cable system of a performance or display of a work
embodied in a primary transmission made by a broadcast station licensed
by the Federal Communications Commission or by an appropriate governmental
authority of Canada or Mexico is actionable as an act of infringement
under section 501, and is fully subject to the remedies provided by sections
502 through 506 and section 510, if the content of the particular program in
which the performance or display is embodied, or any commercial advertising
or station announcements transmitted by the primary transmitter during, 
32 Copyright Law of the United States
§111 Subject Matter and Scope of Copyright
or immediately before or after, the transmission of such program, is in any
way willfully altered by the cable system through changes, deletions, or additions,
except for the alteration, deletion, or substitution of commercial advertisements
performed by those engaged in television commercial advertising
market research: Provided, That the research company has obtained the prior
consent of the advertiser who has purchased the original commercial advertisement,
the television station broadcasting that commercial advertisement, and
the cable system performing the secondary transmission: And provided further,
That such commercial alteration, deletion, or substitution is not performed for
the purpose of deriving income from the sale of that commercial time.
(4) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (1) of this subsection, the
secondary transmission to the public by a cable system of a performance or
display of a work embodied in a primary transmission made by a broadcast
station licensed by an appropriate governmental authority of Canada or Mexico
is actionable as an act of infringement under section 501, and is fully subject
to the remedies provided by sections 502 through 506, if (A) with respect to
Canadian signals, the community of the cable system is located more than 150
miles from the United States-Canadian border and is also located south of the
forty-second parallel of latitude, or (B) with respect to Mexican signals, the
secondary transmission is made by a cable system which received the primary
transmission by means other than direct interception of a free space radio
wave emitted by such broadcast television station, unless prior to April 15,
1976, such cable system was actually carrying, or was specifically authorized
to carry, the signal of such foreign station on the system pursuant to the rules,
regulations, or authorizations of the Federal Communications Commission.
(d) Statutory License for Secondary Transmissions by Cable
Systems.45—
(1) Statement of account and royalty fees.— Subject to paragraph
(5), a cable system whose secondary transmissions have been subject to statutory
licensing under subsection (c) shall, on a semiannual basis, deposit with
the Register of Copyrights, in accordance with requirements that the Register
shall prescribe by regulation the following—
(A) A statement of account, covering the six months next preceding,
specifying the number of channels on which the cable system made secondary
transmissions to its subscribers, the names and locations of all primary
transmitters whose transmissions were further transmitted by the
cable system, the total number of subscribers, the gross amounts paid to
the cable system for the basic service of providing secondary transmissions
of primary broadcast transmitters, and such other data as the Register of
Copyrights may from time to time prescribe by regulation. In determining
the total number of subscribers and the gross amounts paid to the cable system
for the basic service of providing secondary transmissions of primary 
Copyright Law of the United States 33
Subject Matter and Scope of Copyright §111
broadcast transmitters, the cable system shall not include subscribers and
amounts collected from subscribers receiving secondary transmissions pursuant
to section 119. Such statement shall also include a special statement
of account covering any non-network television programming that was
carried by the cable system in whole or in part beyond the local service area
of the primary transmitter, under rules, regulations, or authorizations of
the Federal Communications Commission permitting the substitution or
addition of signals under certain circumstances, together with logs showing
the times, dates, stations, and programs involved in such substituted or
added carriage.
(B) Except in the case of a cable system whose royalty fee is specified in
subparagraph (E) or (F), a total royalty fee payable to copyright owners pursuant
to paragraph (3) for the period covered by the statement, computed
on the basis of specified percentages of the gross receipts from subscribers
to the cable service during such period for the basic service of providing
secondary transmissions of primary broadcast transmitters, as follows:
(i) 1.064 percent of such gross receipts for the privilege of further
transmitting, beyond the local service area of such primary transmitter,
any non-network programming of a primary transmitter in whole or in
part, such amount to be applied against the fee, if any, payable pursuant
to clauses (ii) through (iv);
(ii) 1.064 percent of such gross receipts for the first distant signal
equivalent;
(iii) 0.701 percent of such gross receipts for each of the second, third,
and fourth distant signal equivalents; and
(iv) 0.330 percent of such gross receipts for the fifth distant signal
equivalent and each distant signal equivalent thereafter.
(C) In computing amounts under clauses (ii) through (iv) of subparagraph
(B)—
(i) any fraction of a distant signal equivalent shall be computed at its
fractional value;
(ii) in the case of any cable system located partly within and partly
outside of the local service area of a primary transmitter, gross receipts
shall be limited to those gross receipts derived from subscribers located
outside of the local service area of such primary transmitter; and
(iii) if a cable system provides a secondary transmission of a primary
transmitter to some but not all communities served by that cable
system—
(I) the gross receipts and the distant signal equivalent values for
such secondary transmission shall be derived solely on the basis of
the subscribers in those communities where the cable system provides
such secondary transmission; and 
34 Copyright Law of the United States
§111 Subject Matter and Scope of Copyright
(II) the total royalty fee for the period paid by such system shall
not be less than the royalty fee calculated under subparagraph (B)(i)
multiplied by the gross receipts from all subscribers to the system.
(D) A cable system that, on a statement submitted before the date of the
enactment of the Satellite Television Extension and Localism Act of 2010,
computed its royalty fee consistent with the methodology under subparagraph
(C)(iii), or that amends a statement filed before such date of enactment
to compute the royalty fee due using such methodology, shall not be
subject to an action for infringement, or eligible for any royalty refund or
offset, arising out of its use of such methodology on such statement.
(E) If the actual gross receipts paid by subscribers to a cable system for
the period covered by the statement for the basic service of providing secondary
transmissions of primary broadcast transmitters are $263,800 or less—
(i) gross receipts of the cable system for the purpose of this paragraph
shall be computed by subtracting from such actual gross receipts the
amount by which $263,800 exceeds such actual gross receipts, except
that in no case shall a cable system’s gross receipts be reduced to less
than $10,400; and
(ii) the royalty fee payable under this paragraph to copyright owners
pursuant to paragraph (3) shall be 0.5 percent, regardless of the number
of distant signal equivalents, if any.
(F) If the actual gross receipts paid by subscribers to a cable system for
the period covered by the statement for the basic service of providing secondary
transmissions of primary broadcast transmitters are more than
$263,800 but less than $527,600, the royalty fee payable under this paragraph
to copyright owners pursuant to paragraph (3) shall be—
(i) 0.5 percent of any gross receipts up to $263,800, regardless of the
number of distant signal equivalents, if any; and
(ii) 1 percent of any gross receipts in excess of $263,800, but less than
$527,600, regardless of the number of distant signal equivalents, if any.
(G) A filing fee, as determined by the Register of Copyrights pursuant
to section 708(a).
(2) Handling of fees.— The Register of Copyrights shall receive all fees
(including the filing fee specified in paragraph (1)(G)) deposited under this
section and, after deducting the reasonable costs incurred by the Copyright
Office under this section, shall deposit the balance in the Treasury of the United
States, in such manner as the Secretary of the Treasury directs. All funds
held by the Secretary of the Treasury shall be invested in interest-bearing
United States securities for later distribution with interest by the Librarian of
Congress upon authorization by the Copyright Royalty Judges.
(3) Distribution of royalty fees to copyright owners.— The
royalty fees thus deposited shall, in accordance with the procedures provided by 
Copyright Law of the United States 35
Subject Matter and Scope of Copyright §111
paragraph (4), be distributed to those among the following copyright owners
who claim that their works were the subject of secondary transmissions by
cable systems during the relevant semiannual period:
(A) Any such owner whose work was included in a secondary transmission
made by a cable system of a non-network television program in whole
or in part beyond the local service area of the primary transmitter.
(B) Any such owner whose work was included in a secondary transmission
identified in a special statement of account deposited under paragraph
(1) (A).
(C) Any such owner whose work was included in non-network programming
consisting exclusively of aural signals carried by a cable system in
whole or in part beyond the local service area of the primary transmitter
of such programs.
(4) Procedures for royalty fee distribution.— The royalty fees
thus deposited shall be distributed in accordance with the following procedures:
(A) During the month of July in each year, every person claiming to be
entitled to statutory license fees for secondary transmissions shall file a
claim with the Copyright Royalty Judges, in accordance with requirements
that the Copyright Royalty Judges shall prescribe by regulation. Notwithstanding
any provisions of the antitrust laws, for purposes of this clause any
claimants may agree among themselves as to the proportionate division of
statutory licensing fees among them, may lump their claims together and
file them jointly or as a single claim, or may designate a common agent to
receive payment on their behalf.
(B) After the first day of August of each year, the Copyright Royalty
Judges shall determine whether there exists a controversy concerning the
distribution of royalty fees. If the Copyright Royalty Judges determine that
no such controversy exists, the Copyright Royalty Judges shall authorize
the Librarian of Congress to proceed to distribute such fees to the copyright
owners entitled to receive them, or to their designated agents, subject
to the deduction of reasonable administrative costs under this section. If
the Copyright Royalty Judges find the existence of a controversy, the Copyright
Royalty Judges shall, pursuant to chapter 8 of this title, conduct a
proceeding to determine the distribution of royalty fees.
(C) During the pendency of any proceeding under this subsection, the
Copyright Royalty Judges shall have the discretion to authorize the Librarian
of Congress to proceed to distribute any amounts that are not in
controversy.
(5) 3.75 Percent rate and syndicated exclusivity surcharge not
applicable to multicast streams.— The royalty rates specified in sections
256.2(c) and 256.2(d) of title 37, Code of Federal Regulations (commonly
referred to as the “3.75 percent rate” and the “syndicated exclusivity surcharge”, 
36 Copyright Law of the United States
§111 Subject Matter and Scope of Copyright
respectively), as in effect on the date of the enactment of the Satellite Television
Extension and Localism Act of 2010, as such rates may be adjusted, or such
sections redesignated, thereafter by the Copyright Royalty Judges, shall not
apply to the secondary transmission of a multicast stream.
(6) Verification of accounts and fee payments.— The Register of
Copyrights shall issue regulations to provide for the confidential verification
by copyright owners whose works were embodied in the secondary transmissions
of primary transmissions pursuant to this section of the information
reported on the semiannual statements of account filed under this subsection
for accounting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2010, in order that the
auditor designated under subparagraph (A) is able to confirm the correctness
of the calculations and royalty payments reported therein. The regulations
shall—
(A) establish procedures for the designation of a qualified independent
auditor—
(i) with exclusive authority to request verification of such a statement
of account on behalf of all copyright owners whose works were
the subject of secondary transmissions of primary transmissions by the
cable system (that deposited the statement) during the accounting period
covered by the statement; and
(ii) who is not an officer, employee, or agent of any such copyright
owner for any purpose other than such audit;
(B) establish procedures for safeguarding all nonpublic financial and
business information provided under this paragraph;
(C)(i) require a consultation period for the independent auditor to review
its conclusions with a designee of the cable system;

(e) Nonsimultaneous Secondary Transmissions by Cable Systems.—
(1) Notwithstanding those provisions of the subsection (f)(2) relating to
nonsimultaneous secondary transmissions by a cable system, any such transmissions
are actionable as an act of infringement under section 501, and are
fully subject to the remedies provided by sections 502 through 506 and section
510, unless—
(A) the program on the videotape is transmitted no more than one time
to the cable system’s subscribers;
(B) the copyrighted program, episode, or motion picture videotape, including
the commercials contained within such program, episode, or picture,
is transmitted without deletion or editing;
(C) an owner or officer of the cable system
(i) prevents the duplication of the videotape while in the possession
of the system,
(ii) prevents unauthorized duplication while in the possession of the
facility making the videotape for the system if the system owns or controls
the facility, or takes reasonable precautions to prevent such duplication
if it does not own or control the facility,
(iii) takes adequate precautions to prevent duplication while the tape
is being transported, and
(iv) subject to paragraph (2), erases or destroys, or causes the erasure
or destruction of, the videotape;
(D) within forty-five days after the end of each calendar quarter, an
owner or officer of the cable system executes an affidavit attesting
(i) to the steps and precautions taken to prevent duplication of the
videotape, and
(ii) subject to paragraph (2), to the erasure or destruction of all videotapes
made or used during such quarter;
(E) such owner or officer places or causes each such affidavit, and affidavits
received pursuant to paragraph (2)(C), to be placed in a file, open
to public inspection, at such system’s main office in the community where
the transmission is made or in the nearest community where such system
maintains an office; and
(F) the nonsimultaneous transmission is one that the cable system would
be authorized to transmit under the rules, regulations, and authorizations
of the Federal Communications Commission in effect at the time of the
nonsimultaneous transmission if the transmission had been made simultaneously,
except that this subparagraph shall not apply to inadvertent or
accidental transmissions.
(2) If a cable system transfers to any person a videotape of a program
nonsimultaneously transmitted by it, such transfer is actionable as an act of
infringement under section 501, and is fully subject to the remedies pro-
38 Copyright Law of the United States
§111 Subject Matter and Scope of Copyright
vided by sections 502 through 506, except that, pursuant to a written, nonprofit
contract providing for the equitable sharing of the costs of such
videotape and its transfer, a videotape nonsimultaneously transmitted by it,
in accordance with paragraph (1), may be transferred by one cable system in
Alaska to another system in Alaska, by one cable system in Hawaii permitted
to make such nonsimultaneous transmissions to another such cable system in
Hawaii, or by one cable system in Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, or the
Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands, to another cable system in any of those
five entities, if—
(A) each such contract is available for public inspection in the offices of
the cable systems involved, and a copy of such contract is filed, within thirty
days after such contract is entered into, with the Copyright Office (which
Office shall make each such contract available for public inspection); and
(B) the cable system to which the videotape is transferred complies with
paragraph (1)(A), (B), (C) (i), (iii), and (iv), and (D) through (F);
(C) such system provides a copy of the affidavit required to be made in
accordance with paragraph (1)(D) to each cable system making a previous
nonsimultaneous transmission of the same videotape.
(3) This subsection shall not be construed to supersede the exclusivity protection
provisions of any existing agreement, or any such agreement hereafter
entered into, between a cable system and a television broadcast station in the
area in which the cable system is located, or a network with which such station
is affiliated.
(4) As used in this subsection, the term “videotape” means the reproduction
of the images and sounds of a program or programs broadcast by a television
broadcast station licensed by the Federal Communications Commission, regardless
of the nature of the material objects, such as tapes or films, in which
the reproduction is embodied.
(f) Definitions.—As used in this section, the following terms mean the
following:
(1) Primary transmission.— A “primary transmission” is a transmission
made to the public by a transmitting facility whose signals are being received
and further transmitted by a secondary transmission service, regardless of
where or when the performance or display was first transmitted. In the case of
a television broadcast station, the primary stream and any multicast streams
transmitted by the station constitute primary transmissions.
(2) Secondary transmission.— A “secondary transmission” is the further
transmitting of a primary transmission simultaneously with the primary
transmission, or nonsimultaneously with the primary transmission if by a
cable system not located in whole or in part within the boundary of the fortyeight
contiguous States, Hawaii, or Puerto Rico: Provided, however, That a
nonsimultaneous further transmission by a cable system located in Hawaii 
Copyright Law of the United States 39
Subject Matter and Scope of Copyright §111
of a primary transmission shall be deemed to be a secondary transmission if
the carriage of the television broadcast signal comprising such further transmission
is permissible under the rules, regulations, or authorizations of the
Federal Communications Commission.
(3) Cable system.— A “cable system” is a facility, located in any State,
territory, trust territory, or possession of the United States, that in whole or
in part receives signals transmitted or programs broadcast by one or more
television broadcast stations licensed by the Federal Communications Commission,
and makes secondary transmissions of such signals or programs by
wires, cables, microwave, or other communications channels to subscribing
members of the public who pay for such service. For purposes of determining
the royalty fee under subsection (d)(1), two or more cable systems in contiguous
communities under common ownership or control or operating from one
headend shall be considered as one system.
(4) Local service area of a primary transmitter.— The “local service
area of a primary transmitter”, in the case of both the primary stream and
any multicast streams transmitted by a primary transmitter that is a television
broadcast station, comprises the area where such primary transmitter could
have insisted upon its signal being retransmitted by a cable system pursuant
to the rules, regulations, and authorizations of the Federal Communications
Commission in effect on April 15, 1976, or such station’s television market as
defined in section 76.55(e) of title 47, Code of Federal Regulations (as in effect
on September 18, 1993), or any modifications to such television market made,
on or after September 18, 1993, pursuant to section 76.55(e) or 76.59 of title 47,
Code of Federal Regulations or within the noise-limited contour as defined in
73.622(e)(1) of title 47, Code of Federal Regulations, or in the case of a television
broadcast station licensed by an appropriate governmental authority of
Canada or Mexico, the area in which it would be entitled to insist upon its signal
being retransmitted if it were a television broadcast station subject to such
rules, regulations, and authorizations. In the case of a low power television
station, as defined by the rules and regulations of the Federal Communications
Commission, the “local service area of a primary transmitter” comprises the
designated market area, as defined in section 122(j)(2)(C), that encompasses
the community of license of such station and any community that is located
outside such designated market area that is either wholly or partially within
35 miles of the transmitter site or, in the case of such a station located in a
standard metropolitan statistical area which has one of the 50 largest populations
of all standard metropolitan statistical areas (based on the 1980 decennial
census of population taken by the Secretary of Commerce), wholly or partially
within 20 miles of such transmitter site. The “local service area of a primary
transmitter”, in the case of a radio broadcast station, comprises the primary 
40 Copyright Law of the United States
§111 Subject Matter and Scope of Copyright
service area of such station, pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Federal
Communications Commission.
(5) Distant signal equivalent.—
(A) In general.— Except as provided under subparagraph (B), a “distant
signal equivalent”—
(i) is the value assigned to the secondary transmission of any nonnetwork
television programming carried by a cable system in whole or
in part beyond the local service area of the primary transmitter of such
programming; and
(ii) is computed by assigning a value of one to each primary stream
and to each multicast stream (other than a simulcast) that is an independent
station, and by assigning a value of one-quarter to each primary
stream and to each multicast stream (other than a simulcast) that is a
network station or a noncommercial educational station.
(B) Exceptions.— The values for independent, network, and noncommercial
educational stations specified in subparagraph (A) are subject to
the following:
(i) Where the rules and regulations of the Federal Communications
Commission require a cable system to omit the further transmission
of a particular program and such rules and regulations also permit the
substitution of another program embodying a performance or display
of a work in place of the omitted transmission, or where such rules and
regulations in effect on the date of the enactment of the Copyright Act
of 1976 permit a cable system, at its election, to effect such omission and
substitution of a nonlive program or to carry additional programs not
transmitted by primary transmitters within whose local service area the
cable system is located, no value shall be assigned for the substituted or
additional program.
(ii) Where the rules, regulations, or authorizations of the Federal
Communications Commission in effect on the date of the enactment of
the Copyright Act of 1976 permit a cable system, at its election, to omit
the further transmission of a particular program and such rules, regulations,
or authorizations also permit the substitution of another program
embodying a performance or display of a work in place of the omitted
transmission, the value assigned for the substituted or additional program
shall be, in the case of a live program, the value of one full distant
signal equivalent multiplied by a fraction that has as its numerator the
number of days in the year in which such substitution occurs and as its
denominator the number of days in the year.
(iii) In the case of the secondary transmission of a primary transmitter
that is a television broadcast station pursuant to the late-night or
specialty programming rules of the Federal Communications Commis-
Copyright Law of the United States 41
Subject Matter and Scope of Copyright §111
sion, or the secondary transmission of a primary transmitter that is a
television broadcast station on a part-time basis where full-time carriage
is not possible because the cable system lacks the activated channel capacity
to retransmit on a full-time basis all signals that it is authorized
to carry, the values for independent, network, and noncommercial educational
stations set forth in subparagraph (A), as the case may be, shall
be multiplied by a fraction that is equal to the ratio of the broadcast
hours of such primary transmitter retransmitted by the cable system to
the total broadcast hours of the primary transmitter.
(iv) No value shall be assigned for the secondary transmission of the
primary stream or any multicast streams of a primary transmitter that is
a television broadcast station in any community that is within the local
service area of the primary transmitter.
(6) Network Station.—
(A) Treatment of primary stream.— The term “network station”
shall be applied to a primary stream of a television broadcast station that
is owned or operated by, or affiliated with, one or more of the television
networks in the United States providing nationwide transmissions, and that
transmits a substantial part of the programming supplied by such networks
for a substantial part of the primary stream’s typical broadcast day.
(B) Treatment of Multicast Streams.— The term “network station”
shall be applied to a multicast stream on which a television broadcast
station transmits all or substantially all of the programming of an interconnected
program service that—
(i) is owned or operated by, or affiliated with, one or more of the
television networks described in subparagraph (A); and
(ii) offers programming on a regular basis for 15 or more hours per
week to at least 25 of the affiliated television licensees of the interconnected
program service in 10 or more States.
(7) Independent station.— The term “independent station” shall be
applied to the primary stream or a multicast stream of a television broadcast
station that is not a network station or a noncommercial educational station.
(8) Noncommercial educational station.— The term “noncommercial
educational station” shall be applied to the primary stream or a multicast
stream of a television broadcast station that is a noncommercial educational
broadcast station as defined in section 397 of the Communications Act of 1934,
as in effect on the date of the enactment of the Satellite Television Extension
and Localism Act of 2010.
(9) Primary stream.— A “primary stream” is—
(A) the single digital stream of programming that, before June 12, 2009,
was substantially duplicating the programming transmitted by the television
broadcast station as an analog signal; or
§112
42 Copyright Law of the United States
Subject Matter and Scope of Copyright
(B) if there is no stream described in subparagraph (A), then the single
digital stream of programming transmitted by the television broadcast station
for the longest period of time.
(10) Primary transmitter.— A “primary transmitter” is a television or
radio broadcast station licensed by the Federal Communications Commission,
or by an appropriate governmental authority of Canada or Mexico, that makes
primary transmissions to the public.
(11) Multicast stream.— A “multicast stream” is a digital stream of programming
that is transmitted by a television broadcast station and is not the
station’s primary stream.
(12) Simulcast.— A “simulcast” is a multicast stream of a television broadcast
station that duplicates the programming transmitted by the primary
stream or another multicast stream of such station.
(13) Subscriber; subscribe.—
(A) Subscriber.— The term “subscriber” means a person or entity that
receives a secondary transmission service from a cable system and pays a fee
for the service, directly or indirectly, to the cable system.
(B) Subscribe.— The term “subscribe” means to elect to become a
subscriber.
§112 · Limitations on exclusive rights: Ephemeral recordings46
(a)(1) Notwithstanding the provisions of section 106, and except in the case of
a motion picture or other audiovisual work, it is not an infringement of copyright
for a transmitting organization entitled to transmit to the public a performance
or display of a work, under a license, including a statutory license under section
114(f), or transfer of the copyright or under the limitations on exclusive rights
in sound recordings specified by section 114 (a) or for a transmitting organization
that is a broadcast radio or television station licensed as such by the Federal
Communications Commission and that makes a broadcast transmission of a
performance of a sound recording in a digital format on a nonsubscription basis,
to make no more than one copy or phonorecord of a particular transmission
program embodying the performance or display, if—
(A) the copy or phonorecord is retained and used solely by the transmitting
organization that made it, and no further copies or phonorecords are
reproduced from it; and
(B) the copy or phonorecord is used solely for the transmitting organization’s
own transmissions within its local service area, or for purposes of
archival preservation or security; and
Copyright Law of the United States 43
Subject Matter and Scope of Copyright §112
(C) unless preserved exclusively for archival purposes, the copy or phonorecord
is destroyed within six months from the date the transmission
program was first transmitted to the public.
(2) In a case in which a transmitting organization entitled to make a copy
or phonorecord under paragraph (1) in connection with the transmission
to the public of a performance or display of a work is prevented from making
such copy or phonorecord by reason of the application by the copyright
owner of technical measures that prevent the reproduction of the work, the
copyright owner shall make available to the transmitting organization the
necessary means for permitting the making of such copy or phonorecord as
permitted under that paragraph, if it is technologically feasible and economically
reasonable for the copyright owner to do so. If the copyright owner fails
to do so in a timely manner in light of the transmitting organization’s reasonable
business requirements, the transmitting organization shall not be liable
for a violation of section 1201(a)(1) of this title for engaging in such activities
as are necessary to make such copies or phonorecords as permitted under
paragraph (1) of this subsection.
(b) Notwithstanding the provisions of section 106, it is not an infringement of
copyright for a governmental body or other nonprofit organization entitled to
transmit a performance or display of a work, under section 110(2) or under the
limitations on exclusive rights in sound recordings specified by section 114(a), to
make no more than thirty copies or phonorecords of a particular transmission
program embodying the performance or display, if—
(1) no further copies or phonorecords are reproduced from the copies or
phonorecords made under this clause; and
(2) except for one copy or phonorecord that may be preserved exclusively
for archival purposes, the copies or phonorecords are destroyed within seven
years from the date the transmission program was first transmitted to the
public.
(c) Notwithstanding the provisions of section 106, it is not an infringement
of copyright for a governmental body or other nonprofit organization to make
for distribution no more than one copy or phonorecord, for each transmitting
organization specified in clause (2) of this subsection, of a particular transmission
program embodying a performance of a nondramatic musical work of a religious
nature, or of a sound recording of such a musical work, if—
(1) there is no direct or indirect charge for making or distributing any such
copies or phonorecords; and
(2) none of such copies or phonorecords is used for any performance other
than a single transmission to the public by a transmitting organization entitled
to transmit to the public a performance of the work under a license or transfer
of the copyright; and
44 Copyright Law of the United States
§112 Subject Matter and Scope of Copyright
(3) except for one copy or phonorecord that may be preserved exclusively
for archival purposes, the copies or phonorecords are all destroyed within one
year from the date the transmission program was first transmitted to the public.
(d) Notwithstanding the provisions of section 106, it is not an infringement of
copyright for a governmental body or other nonprofit organization entitled to
transmit a performance of a work under section 110(8) to make no more than ten
copies or phonorecords embodying the performance, or to permit the use of any
such copy or phonorecord by any governmental body or nonprofit organization
entitled to transmit a performance of a work under section 110(8), if—
(1) any such copy or phonorecord is retained and used solely by the organization
that made it, or by a governmental body or nonprofit organization
entitled to transmit a performance of a work under section 110(8), and no
further copies or phonorecords are reproduced from it; and
(2) any such copy or phonorecord is used solely for transmissions authorized
under section 110(8), or for purposes of archival preservation or security; and
(3) the governmental body or nonprofit organization permitting any use
of any such copy or phonorecord by any governmental body or nonprofit
organization under this subsection does not make any charge for such use.
(e) Statutory License.—(1) A transmitting organization entitled to transmit
to the public a performance of a sound recording under the limitation on
exclusive rights specified by section 114(d)(1)(C)(iv) or under a statutory license
in accordance with section 114(f) is entitled to a statutory license, under the conditions
specified by this subsection, to make no more than 1 phonorecord of the
sound recording (unless the terms and conditions of the statutory license allow
for more), if the following conditions are satisfied:
(A) The phonorecord is retained and used solely by the transmitting organization
that made it, and no further phonorecords are reproduced from it.
(B) The phonorecord is used solely for the transmitting organization’s
own transmissions originating in the United States under a statutory license
in accordance with section 114(f) or the limitation on exclusive rights specified
by section 114(d)(1)(C)(iv).
(C) Unless preserved exclusively for purposes of archival preservation,
the phonorecord is destroyed within 6 months from the date the sound
recording was first transmitted to the public using the phonorecord.
(D) Phonorecords of the sound recording have been distributed to the
public under the authority of the copyright owner or the copyright owner
authorizes the transmitting entity to transmit the sound recording, and the
transmitting entity makes the phonorecord under this subsection from a
phonorecord lawfully made and acquired under the authority of the copyright
owner.
(2) Notwithstanding any provision of the antitrust laws, any copyright owners
of sound recordings and any transmitting organizations entitled to a statu-
Copyright Law of the United States 45
Subject Matter and Scope of Copyright §112
tory license under this subsection may negotiate and agree upon royalty rates
and license terms and conditions for making phonorecords of such sound recordings
under this section and the proportionate division of fees paid among
copyright owners, and may designate common agents to negotiate, agree to,
pay, or receive such royalty payments.
(3) Proceedings under chapter 8 shall determine reasonable rates and terms
of royalty payments for the activities specified by paragraph (1) during the
5-year period beginning on January 1 of the second year following the year
in which the proceedings are to be commenced, or such other period as the
parties may agree. Such rates shall include a minimum fee for each type of
service offered by transmitting organizations. Any copyright owners of sound
recordings or any transmitting organizations entitled to a statutory license
under this subsection may submit to the Copyright Royalty Judges licenses
covering such activities with respect to such sound recordings. The parties to
each proceeding shall bear their own costs.
(4) The schedule of reasonable rates and terms determined by the Copyright
Royalty Judges shall, subject to paragraph (5), be binding on all copyright
owners of sound recordings and transmitting organizations entitled to
a statutory license under this subsection during the 5-year period specified
in paragraph (3), or such other period as the parties may agree. Such rates
shall include a minimum fee for each type of service offered by transmitting
organizations. The Copyright Royalty Judges shall establish rates that
most clearly represent the fees that would have been negotiated in the marketplace
between a willing buyer and a willing seller. In determining such
rates and terms, the Copyright Royalty Judges shall base their decision on economic,
competitive, and programming information presented by the parties,
including—
(A) whether use of the service may substitute for or may promote the
sales of phonorecords or otherwise interferes with or enhances the copyright
owner’s traditional streams of revenue; and
(B) the relative roles of the copyright owner and the transmitting organization
in the copyrighted work and the service made available to the public
with respect to relative creative contribution, technological contribution,
capital investment, cost, and risk.
In establishing such rates and terms, the Copyright Royalty Judges may consider
the rates and terms under voluntary license agreements described in paragraphs
(2) and (3). The Copyright Royalty Judges shall also establish requirements
by which copyright owners may receive reasonable notice of the use of their
sound recordings under this section, and under which records of such use shall
be kept and made available by transmitting organizations entitled to obtain a
statutory license under this subsection.
§112
46 Copyright Law of the United States
Subject Matter and Scope of Copyright
(5) License agreements voluntarily negotiated at any time between 1 or
more copyright owners of sound recordings and 1 or more transmitting organizations
entitled to obtain a statutory license under this subsection shall be
given effect in lieu of any decision by the Librarian of Congress or determination
by the Copyright Royalty Judges.
(6)(A) Any person who wishes to make a phonorecord of a sound recording
under a statutory license in accordance with this subsection may do so without
infringing the exclusive right of the copyright owner of the sound recording
under section 106(1)—
(i) by complying with such notice requirements as the Copyright Royalty
Judges shall prescribe by regulation and by paying royalty fees in
accordance with this subsection; or
(ii) if such royalty fees have not been set, by agreeing to pay such royalty
fees as shall be determined in accordance with this subsection.
(B) Any royalty payments in arrears shall be made on or before the 20th
day of the month next succeeding the month in which the royalty fees are
set.
(7) If a transmitting organization entitled to make a phonorecord under
this subsection is prevented from making such phonorecord by reason of
the application by the copyright owner of technical measures that prevent
the reproduction of the sound recording, the copyright owner shall make
available to the transmitting organization the necessary means for permitting
the making of such phonorecord as permitted under this subsection, if it
is technologically feasible and economically reasonable for the copyright
owner to do so. If the copyright owner fails to do so in a timely manner in
light of the transmitting organization’s reasonable business requirements, the
transmitting organization shall not be liable for a violation of section 1201(a)
(1) of this title for engaging in such activities as are necessary to make such
phonorecords as permitted under this subsection.
(8) Nothing in this subsection annuls, limits, impairs, or otherwise affects
in any way the existence or value of any of the exclusive rights of the copyright
owners in a sound recording, except as otherwise provided in this subsection,
or in a musical work, including the exclusive rights to reproduce and
distribute a sound recording or musical work, including by means of a digital
phonorecord delivery, under section 106(1), 106(3), and 115, and the right to
perform publicly a sound recording or musical work, including by means of
a digital audio transmission, under sections 106(4) and 106(6).
(f)(1) Notwithstanding the provisions of section 106, and without limiting the
application of subsection (b), it is not an infringement of copyright for a governmental
body or other nonprofit educational institution entitled under section
110(2) to transmit a performance or display to make copies or phonorecords of a
work that is in digital form and, solely to the extent permitted in paragraph (2), of 
Copyright Law of the United States 47
Subject Matter and Scope of Copyright §113
a work that is in analog form, embodying the performance or display to be used
for making transmissions authorized under section 110(2), if—
(A) such copies or phonorecords are retained and used solely by the body
or institution that made them, and no further copies or phonorecords are
reproduced from them, except as authorized under section 110(2); and
(B) such copies or phonorecords are used solely for transmissions authorized
under section 110(2).
(2) This subsection does not authorize the conversion of print or other
analog versions of works into digital formats, except that such conversion is
permitted hereunder, only with respect to the amount of such works authorized
to be performed or displayed under section 110(2), if—
(A) no digital version of the work is available to the institution; or
(B) the digital version of the work that is available to the institution is
subject to technological protection measures that prevent its use for section
110(2).
(g) The transmission program embodied in a copy or phonorecord made under
this section is not subject to protection as a derivative work under this title
except with the express consent of the owners of copyright in the preexisting
works employed in the program.
§113 · Scope of exclusive rights in pictorial, graphic,
and sculptural works47
(a) Subject to the provisions of subsections (b) and (c) of this section, the exclusive
right to reproduce a copyrighted pictorial, graphic, or sculptural work in
copies under section 106 includes the right to reproduce the work in or on any
kind of article, whether useful or otherwise.
(b) This title does not afford, to the owner of copyright in a work that portrays
a useful article as such, any greater or lesser rights with respect to the making,
distribution, or display of the useful article so portrayed than those afforded to
such works under the law, whether title 17 or the common law or statutes of a
State, in effect on December 31, 1977, as held applicable and construed by a court
in an action brought under this title.
(c) In the case of a work lawfully reproduced in useful articles that have been
offered for sale or other distribution to the public, copyright does not include any
right to prevent the making, distribution, or display of pictures or photographs
of such articles in connection with advertisements or commentaries related to
the distribution or display of such articles, or in connection with news reports.
(d)(1) In a case in which—
(A) a work of visual art has been incorporated in or made part of a building
in such a way that removing the work from the building will cause the 
§114
48 Copyright Law of the United States
Subject Matter and Scope of Copyright
destruction, distortion, mutilation, or other modification of the work as
described in section 106A(a)(3), and
(B) the author consented to the installation of the work in the building
either before the effective date set forth in section 610(a) of the Visual
Artists Rights Act of 1990, or in a written instrument executed on or after
such effective date that is signed by the owner of the building and the
author and that specifies that installation of the work may subject the work
to destruction, distortion, mutilation, or other modification, by reason of
its removal, then the rights conferred by paragraphs (2) and (3) of section
106A(a) shall not apply.
(2) If the owner of a building wishes to remove a work of visual art which is
a part of such building and which can be removed from the building without
the destruction, distortion, mutilation, or other modification of the work as
described in section 106A(a)(3), the author’s rights under paragraphs (2) and
(3) of section 106A(a) shall apply unless—
(A) the owner has made a diligent, good faith attempt without success
to notify the author of the owner’s intended action affecting the work of
visual art, or
(B) the owner did provide such notice in writing and the person so notified
failed, within 90 days after receiving such notice, either to remove the
work or to pay for its removal.
For purposes of subparagraph (A), an owner shall be presumed to have
made a diligent, good faith attempt to send notice if the owner sent such notice
by registered mail to the author at the most recent address of the author that
was recorded with the Register of Copyrights pursuant to paragraph (3). If the
work is removed at the expense of the author, title to that copy of the work
shall be deemed to be in the author.
(3) The Register of Copyrights shall establish a system of records whereby
any author of a work of visual art that has been incorporated in or made part
of a building, may record his or her identity and address with the Copyright
Office. The Register shall also establish procedures under which any such
author may update the information so recorded, and procedures under which
owners of buildings may record with the Copyright Office evidence of their
efforts to comply with this subsection.
§114 · Scope of exclusive rights in sound recordings48
(a) The exclusive rights of the owner of copyright in a sound recording are
limited to the rights specified by clauses (1), (2), (3) and (6) of section 106, and do
not include any right of performance under section 106(4).
Copyright Law of the United States 49

(b) The exclusive right of the owner of copyright in a sound recording under
clause (1) of section 106 is limited to the right to duplicate the sound recording in
the form of phonorecords or copies that directly or indirectly recapture the actual
sounds fixed in the recording. The exclusive right of the owner of copyright in a
sound recording under clause (2) of section 106 is limited to the right to prepare
a derivative work in which the actual sounds fixed in the sound recording are
rearranged, remixed, or otherwise altered in sequence or quality. The exclusive
rights of the owner of copyright in a sound recording under clauses (1) and (2)
of section 106 do not extend to the making or duplication of another sound
recording that consists entirely of an independent fixation of other sounds, even
though such sounds imitate or simulate those in the copyrighted sound recording.
The exclusive rights of the owner of copyright in a sound recording under
clauses (1), (2), and (3) of section 106 do not apply to sound recordings included
in educational television and radio programs (as defined in section 397 of title 47)
distributed or transmitted by or through public broadcasting entities (as defined
by section 118(f)): Provided, That copies or phonorecords of said programs are
not commercially distributed by or through public broadcasting entities to the
general public.
(c) This section does not limit or impair the exclusive right to perform publicly,
by means of a phonorecord, any of the works specified by section 106(4).
(d) Limitations on Exclusive Right.—Notwithstanding the provisions
of section 106(6)—
(1) Exempt transmissions and retransmissions.—The performance
of a sound recording publicly by means of a digital audio transmission,
other than as a part of an interactive service, is not an infringement of section
106(6) if the performance is part of—
(A) a nonsubscription broadcast transmission;
(B) a retransmission of a nonsubscription broadcast transmission: Provided,
That, in the case of a retransmission of a radio station’s broadcast
transmission—
(i) the radio station’s broadcast transmission is not willfully or repeatedly
retransmitted more than a radius of 150 miles from the site of the
radio broadcast transmitter, however—
(I) the 150 mile limitation under this clause shall not apply when
a nonsubscription broadcast transmission by a radio station licensed
by the Federal Communications Commission is retransmitted on a
nonsubscription basis by a terrestrial broadcast station, terrestrial
translator, or terrestrial repeater licensed by the Federal Communications
Commission; and
(II) in the case of a subscription retransmission of a nonsubscription
broadcast retransmission covered by subclause (I), the 150 mile 
50 Copyright Law of the United States
§114 Subject Matter and Scope of Copyright
radius shall be measured from the transmitter site of such broadcast
retransmitter;
(ii) the retransmission is of radio station broadcast transmissions
that are—
(I) obtained by the retransmitter over the air;
(II) not electronically processed by the retransmitter to deliver
separate and discrete signals; and
(III) retransmitted only within the local communities served by
the retransmitter;
(iii) the radio station’s broadcast transmission was being retransmitted
to cable systems (as defined in section 111(f)) by a satellite carrier
on January 1, 1995, and that retransmission was being retransmitted by
cable systems as a separate and discrete signal, and the satellite carrier
obtains the radio station’s broadcast transmission in an analog format:
Provided, That the broadcast transmission being retransmitted may embody
the programming of no more than one radio station; or
(iv) the radio station’s broadcast transmission is made by a noncommercial
educational broadcast station funded on or after January 1, 1995,
under section 396(k) of the Communications Act of 1934 (47 U.S.C.
396(k)), consists solely of noncommercial educational and cultural radio
programs, and the retransmission, whether or not simultaneous, is
a nonsubscription terrestrial broadcast retransmission; or
(C) a transmission that comes within any of the following categories—
(i) a prior or simultaneous transmission incidental to an exempt
transmission, such as a feed received by and then retransmitted by an
exempt transmitter: Provided, That such incidental transmissions do not
include any subscription transmission directly for reception by members
of the public;
(ii) a transmission within a business establishment, confined to its
premises or the immediately surrounding vicinity;
(iii) a retransmission by any retransmitter, including a multichannel
video programming distributor as defined in section 602(12) of the
Communications Act of 1934 (47 U.S.C. 522 (12)), of a transmission by a
transmitter licensed to publicly perform the sound recording as a part of
that transmission, if the retransmission is simultaneous with the licensed
transmission and authorized by the transmitter; or
(iv) a transmission to a business establishment for use in the ordinary
course of its business: Provided, That the business recipient does not retransmit
the transmission outside of its premises or the immediately surrounding
vicinity, and that the transmission does not exceed the sound
recording performance complement. Nothing in this clause shall limit
the scope of the exemption in clause (ii).

(2) Statutory licensing of certain transmissions.—
The performance of a sound recording publicly by means of a subscription
digital audio transmission not exempt under paragraph (1), an eligible
nonsubscription transmission, or a transmission not exempt under paragraph
(1) that is made by a preexisting satellite digital audio radio service shall be
subject to statutory licensing, in accordance with subsection (f) if—
(A)(i) the transmission is not part of an interactive service;
(ii) except in the case of a transmission to a business establishment,
the transmitting entity does not automatically and intentionally cause
any device receiving the transmission to switch from one program channel
to another; and
(iii) except as provided in section 1002(e), the transmission of the sound
recording is accompanied, if technically feasible, by the information
encoded in that sound recording, if any, by or under the authority of
the copyright owner of that sound recording, that identifies the title
of the sound recording, the featured recording artist who performs on
the sound recording, and related information, including information
concerning the underlying musical work and its writer;
(B) in the case of a subscription transmission not exempt under paragraph
(1) that is made by a preexisting subscription service in the same
transmission medium used by such service on July 31, 1998, or in the case of
a transmission not exempt under paragraph (1) that is made by a preexisting
satellite digital audio radio service—
(i) the transmission does not exceed the sound recording performance
complement; and
(ii) the transmitting entity does not cause to be published by means
of an advance program schedule or prior announcement the titles of
the specific sound recordings or phonorecords embodying such sound
recordings to be transmitted; and
(C) in the case of an eligible nonsubscription transmission or a subscription
transmission not exempt under paragraph (1) that is made by a new
subscription service or by a preexisting subscription service other than in
the same transmission medium used by such service on July 31, 1998—
(i) the transmission does not exceed the sound recording performance
complement, except that this requirement shall not apply in the
case of a retransmission of a broadcast transmission if the retransmission
is made by a transmitting entity that does not have the right or
ability to control the programming of the broadcast station making the
broadcast transmission, unless—
(I) the broadcast station makes broadcast transmissions—
(aa) in digital format that regularly exceed the sound recording
performance complement; or
52 Copyright Law of the United States
114 Subject Matter and Scope of Copyright
(bb) in analog format, a substantial portion of which, on a
weekly basis, exceed the sound recording performance complement;
and
(II) the sound recording copyright owner or its representative has
notified the transmitting entity in writing that broadcast transmissions
of the copyright owner’s sound recordings exceed the sound
recording performance complement as provided in this clause;
(ii) the transmitting entity does not cause to be published, or induce
or facilitate the publication, by means of an advance program schedule
or prior announcement, the titles of the specific sound recordings to be
transmitted, the phonorecords embodying such sound recordings, or,
other than for illustrative purposes, the names of the featured recording
artists, except that this clause does not disqualify a transmitting entity
that makes a prior announcement that a particular artist will be featured
within an unspecified future time period, and in the case of a retransmission
of a broadcast transmission by a transmitting entity that does not
have the right or ability to control the programming of the broadcast
transmission, the requirement of this clause shall not apply to a prior
oral announcement by the broadcast station, or to an advance program
schedule published, induced, or facilitated by the broadcast station, if
the transmitting entity does not have actual knowledge and has not received
written notice from the copyright owner or its representative that
the broadcast station publishes or induces or facilitates the publication
of such advance program schedule, or if such advance program schedule
is a schedule of classical music programming published by the broadcast
station in the same manner as published by that broadcast station on or
before September 30, 1998;
(iii) the transmission—
(I) is not part of an archived program of less than 5 hours duration;
(II) is not part of an archived program of 5 hours or greater in duration
that is made available for a period exceeding 2 weeks;
(III) is not part of a continuous program which is of less than 3
hours duration; or
(IV) is not part of an identifiable program in which performances
of sound recordings are rendered in a predetermined order, other
than an archived or continuous program, that is transmitted at—
(aa) more than 3 times in any 2-week period that have been
publicly announced in advance, in the case of a program of less
than 1 hour in duration, or
(bb) more than 4 times in any 2-week period that have been
publicly announced in advance, in the case of a program of 1 hour
or more in duration, except that the requirement of this sub-
Copyright Law of the United States 53
Subject Matter and Scope of Copyright §114
clause shall not apply in the case of a retransmission of a broadcast
transmission by a transmitting entity that does not have the
right or ability to control the programming of the broadcast
transmission, unless the transmitting entity is given notice in
writing by the copyright owner of the sound recording that the
broadcast station makes broadcast transmissions that regularly
violate such requirement;
(iv) the transmitting entity does not knowingly perform the sound
recording, as part of a service that offers transmissions of visual images
contemporaneously with transmissions of sound recordings, in a
manner that is likely to cause confusion, to cause mistake, or to deceive,
as to the affiliation, connection, or association of the copyright owner
or featured recording artist with the transmitting entity or a particular
product or service advertised by the transmitting entity, or as to the
origin, sponsorship, or approval by the copyright owner or featured
recording artist of the activities of the transmitting entity other than the
performance of the sound recording itself;
(v) the transmitting entity cooperates to prevent, to the extent feasible
without imposing substantial costs or burdens, a transmission recipient
or any other person or entity from automatically scanning the transmitting
entity’s transmissions alone or together with transmissions by other
transmitting entities in order to select a particular sound recording to be
transmitted to the transmission recipient, except that the requirement
of this clause shall not apply to a satellite digital audio service that is in
operation, or that is licensed by the Federal Communications Commission,
on or before July 31, 1998;
(vi) the transmitting entity takes no affirmative steps to cause or induce
the making of a phonorecord by the transmission recipient, and if
the technology used by the transmitting entity enables the transmitting
entity to limit the making by the transmission recipient of phonorecords
of the transmission directly in a digital format, the transmitting entity
sets such technology to limit such making of phonorecords to the extent
permitted by such technology;
(vii) phonorecords of the sound recording have been distributed to
the public under the authority of the copyright owner or the copyright
owner authorizes the transmitting entity to transmit the sound recording,
and the transmitting entity makes the transmission from a phonorecord
lawfully made under the authority of the copyright owner, except
that the requirement of this clause shall not apply to a retransmission
of a broadcast transmission by a transmitting entity that does not have
the right or ability to control the programming of the broadcast transmission,
unless the transmitting entity is given notice in writing by the 
§114
54 Copyright Law of the United States
Subject Matter and Scope of Copyright
copyright owner of the sound recording that the broadcast station makes
broadcast transmissions that regularly violate such requirement;
(viii) the transmitting entity accommodates and does not interfere
with the transmission of technical measures that are widely used by
sound recording copyright owners to identify or protect copyrighted
works, and that are technically feasible of being transmitted by the transmitting
entity without imposing substantial costs on the transmitting
entity or resulting in perceptible aural or visual degradation of the
digital signal, except that the requirement of this clause shall not apply
to a satellite digital audio service that is in operation, or that is licensed
under the authority of the Federal Communications Commission, on or
before July 31, 1998, to the extent that such service has designed, developed,
or made commitments to procure equipment or technology that
is not compatible with such technical measures before such technical
measures are widely adopted by sound recording copyright owners; and
(ix) the transmitting entity identifies in textual data the sound recording
during, but not before, the time it is performed, including the title
of the sound recording, the title of the phonorecord embodying such
sound recording, if any, and the featured recording artist, in a manner
to permit it to be displayed to the transmission recipient by the device or
technology intended for receiving the service provided by the transmitting
entity, except that the obligation in this clause shall not take effect
until 1 year after the date of the enactment of the Digital Millennium
Copyright Act and shall not apply in the case of a retransmission of a
broadcast transmission by a transmitting entity that does not have the
right or ability to control the programming of the broadcast transmission,
or in the case in which devices or technology intended for receiving
the service provided by the transmitting entity that have the capability to
display such textual data are not common in the marketplace.
(3) Licenses for transmissions by interactive services.—
(A) No interactive service shall be granted an exclusive license under section
106(6) for the performance of a sound recording publicly by means of
digital audio transmission for a period in excess of 12 months, except that
with respect to an exclusive license granted to an interactive service by a
licensor that holds the copyright to 1,000 or fewer sound recordings, the
period of such license shall not exceed 24 months: Provided, however, That
the grantee of such exclusive license shall be ineligible to receive another
exclusive license for the performance of that sound recording for a period
of 13 months from the expiration of the prior exclusive license.
(B) The limitation set forth in subparagraph (A) of this paragraph shall
not apply if—
Copyright Law of the United States 55
Subject Matter and Scope of Copyright §114
(i) the licensor has granted and there remain in effect licenses under
section 106(6) for the public performance of sound recordings by means
of digital audio transmission by at least 5 different interactive services;
Provided, however, That each such license must be for a minimum of
10 percent of the copyrighted sound recordings owned by the licensor
that have been licensed to interactive services, but in no event less than
50 sound recordings; or
(ii) the exclusive license is granted to perform publicly up to 45 seconds
of a sound recording and the sole purpose of the performance is
to promote the distribution or performance of that sound recording.
(C) Notwithstanding the grant of an exclusive or nonexclusive license
of the right of public performance under section 106(6), an interactive
service may not publicly perform a sound recording unless a license has
been granted for the public performance of any copyrighted musical work
contained in the sound recording: Provided, That such license to publicly
perform the copyrighted musical work may be granted either by a performing
rights society representing the copyright owner or by the copyright
owner.
(D) The performance of a sound recording by means of a retransmission
of a digital audio transmission is not an infringement of section
106(6) if—
(i) the retransmission is of a transmission by an interactive service
licensed to publicly perform the sound recording to a particular member
of the public as part of that transmission; and
(ii) the retransmission is simultaneous with the licensed transmission,
authorized by the transmitter, and limited to that particular member of
the public intended by the interactive service to be the recipient of the
transmission.
(E) For the purposes of this paragraph—
(i) a “licensor” shall include the licensing entity and any other entity
under any material degree of common ownership, management, or control
that owns copyrights in sound recordings; and
(ii) a “performing rights society” is an association or corporation that
licenses the public performance of nondramatic musical works on behalf
of the copyright owner, such as the American Society of Composers,
Authors and Publishers, Broadcast Music, Inc., and SESAC, Inc.
(4) Rights not otherwise limited.—
(A) Except as expressly provided in this section, this section does not
limit or impair the exclusive right to perform a sound recording publicly
by means of a digital audio transmission under section 106(6).
(B) Nothing in this section annuls or limits in any way—
§114
56 Copyright Law of the United States
Subject Matter and Scope of Copyright
(i) the exclusive right to publicly perform a musical work, including
by means of a digital audio transmission, under section 106(4);
(ii) the exclusive rights in a sound recording or the musical work
embodied therein under sections 106(1), 106(2) and 106(3); or
(iii) any other rights under any other clause of section 106, or remedies
available under this title as such rights or remedies exist either
before or after the date of enactment of the Digital Performance Right
in Sound Recordings Act of 1995.
(C) Any limitations in this section on the exclusive right under section
106(6) apply only to the exclusive right under section 106(6) and not to any
other exclusive rights under section 106. Nothing in this section shall be
construed to annul, limit, impair or otherwise affect in any way the ability
of the owner of a copyright in a sound recording to exercise the rights
under sections 106(1), 106(2) and 106(3), or to obtain the remedies available
under this title pursuant to such rights, as such rights and remedies exist
either before or after the date of enactment of the Digital Performance
Right in Sound Recordings Act of 1995.
(e) Authority for Negotiations.—
(1) Notwithstanding any provision of the antitrust laws, in negotiating statutory
licenses in accordance with subsection (f), any copyright owners of sound
recordings and any entities performing sound recordings affected by this section
may negotiate and agree upon the royalty rates and license terms and
conditions for the performance of such sound recordings and the proportionate
division of fees paid among copyright owners, and may designate common
agents on a nonexclusive basis to negotiate, agree to, pay, or receive payments.
(2) For licenses granted under section 106(6), other than statutory licenses,
such as for performances by interactive services or performances that exceed
the sound recording performance complement—
(A) copyright owners of sound recordings affected by this section may
designate common agents to act on their behalf to grant licenses and receive
and remit royalty payments: Provided, That each copyright owner
shall establish the royalty rates and material license terms and conditions
unilaterally, that is, not in agreement, combination, or concert with other
copyright owners of sound recordings; and
(B) entities performing sound recordings affected by this section may
designate common agents to act on their behalf to obtain licenses and collect
and pay royalty fees: Provided, That each entity performing sound recordings
shall determine the royalty rates and material license terms and
conditions unilaterally, that is, not in agreement, combination, or concert
with other entities performing sound recordings.
(f) Licenses for Certain Nonexempt Transmissions.
Copyright Law of the United States 57
Subject Matter and Scope of Copyright §114
(1)(A) Proceedings under chapter 8 shall determine reasonable rates and
terms of royalty payments for subscription transmissions by preexisting subscription
services and transmissions by preexisting satellite digital audio radio
services specified by subsection (d)(2) during the 5-year period beginning on
January 1 of the second year following the year in which the proceedings are to
be commenced, except in the case of a different transitional period provided
under section 6(b)(3) of the Copyright Royalty and Distribution Reform Act
of 2004, or such other period as the parties may agree. Such terms and rates
shall distinguish among the different types of digital audio transmission services
then in operation. Any copyright owners of sound recordings, preexisting
subscription services, or preexisting satellite digital audio radio services
may submit to the Copyright Royalty Judges licenses covering such subscription
transmissions with respect to such sound recordings. The parties to each
proceeding shall bear their own costs.
(B) The schedule of reasonable rates and terms determined by the
Copyright Royalty Judges shall, subject to paragraph (3), be binding on all
copyright owners of sound recordings and entities performing sound recordings
affected by this paragraph during the 5-year period specified in
subparagraph (A), a transitional period provided under section 6(b)(3) of
the Copyright Royalty and Distribution Reform Act of 2004, or such other
period as the parties may agree. In establishing rates and terms for preexisting
subscription services and preexisting satellite digital audio radio services,
in addition to the objectives set forth in section 801(b)(1), the Copyright
Royalty Judges may consider the rates and terms for comparable types of
subscription digital audio transmission services and comparable circumstances
under voluntary license agreements described in subparagraph (A).
(C) The procedures under subparagraphs (A) and (B) also shall be initiated
pursuant to a petition filed by any copyright owners of sound recordings,
any preexisting subscription services, or any preexisting satellite digital
audio radio services indicating that a new type of subscription digital audio
transmission service on which sound recordings are performed is or
is about to become operational, for the purpose of determining reasonable
terms and rates of royalty payments with respect to such new type of
transmission service for the period beginning with the inception of such
new type of service and ending on the date on which the royalty rates and
terms for subscription digital audio transmission services most recently
determined under subparagraph (A) or (B) and chapter 8 expire, or such
other period as the parties may agree.
(2)(A) Proceedings under chapter 8 shall determine reasonable rates and
terms of royalty payments for public performances of sound recordings by
means of eligible nonsubscription transmission services and new subscription
services specified by subsection (d)(2) during the 5-year period beginning on 
§114

Subject Matter and Scope of Copyright
January 1 of the second year following the year in which the proceedings are to
be commenced, except in the case of a different transitional period provided
under section 6(b)(3) of the Copyright Royalty and Distribution Reform Act
of 2004, or such other period as the parties may agree. Such rates and terms
shall distinguish among the different types of eligible nonsubscription transmission
services and new subscription services then in operation and shall
include a minimum fee for each such type of service. Any copyright owners
of sound recordings or any entities performing sound recordings affected by
this paragraph may submit to the Copyright Royalty Judges licenses covering
such eligible nonsubscription transmissions and new subscription services
with respect to such sound recordings. The parties to each proceeding shall
bear their own costs.
(B) The schedule of reasonable rates and terms determined by the
Copyright Royalty Judges shall, subject to paragraph (3), be binding on all
copyright owners of sound recordings and entities performing sound recordings
affected by this paragraph during the 5-year period specified in
subparagraph (A), a transitional period provided under section 6(b)(3) of
the Copyright Royalty and Distribution Act of 2004, or such other period
as the parties may agree. Such rates and terms shall distinguish among the
different types of eligible nonsubscription transmission services then in operation
and shall include a minimum fee for each such type of service, such
differences to be based on criteria including, but not limited to, the quantity
and nature of the use of sound recordings and the degree to which use of the
service may substitute for or may promote the purchase of phonorecords by
consumers. In establishing rates and terms for transmissions by eligible nonsubscription
services and new subscription services, the Copyright Royalty
Judges shall establish rates and terms that most clearly represent the rates
and terms that would have been negotiated in the marketplace between a
willing buyer and a willing seller. In determining such rates and terms, the
Copyright Royalty Judges shall base their49 decision on economic, competitive
and programming information presented by the parties, including—
(i) whether use of the service may substitute for or may promote the
sales of phonorecords or otherwise may interfere with or may enhance
the sound recording copyright owner’s other streams of revenue from
its sound recordings; and
(ii) the relative roles of the copyright owner and the transmitting entity
in the copyrighted work and the service made available to the public
with respect to relative creative contribution, technological contribution,
capital investment, cost, and risk.
In establishing such rates and terms, the Copyright Royalty Judges may
consider the rates and terms for comparable types of digital audio trans-
Copyright Law of the United States 59
Subject Matter and Scope of Copyright §114
mission services and comparable circumstances under voluntary license
agreements described in subparagraph (A).
(C) The procedures under subparagraphs (A) and (B) shall also be initiated
pursuant to a petition filed by any copyright owners of sound recordings
or any eligible nonsubscription service or new subscription service indicating
that a new type of eligible nonsubscription service or new subscription
service on which sound recordings are performed is or is about to become
operational, for the purpose of determining reasonable terms and rates of
royalty payments with respect to such new type of service for the period
beginning with the inception of such new type of service and ending on
the date on which the royalty rates and terms for eligible nonsubscription
services and new subscription services, as the case may be, most recently
determined under subparagraph (A) or (B) and chapter 8 expire, or such
other period as the parties may agree.
(3) License agreements voluntarily negotiated at any time between 1 or
more copyright owners of sound recordings and 1 or more entities performing
sound recordings shall be given effect in lieu of any decision by the Librarian
of Congress or determination by the Copyright Royalty Judges.
(4)(A) The Copyright Royalty Judges shall also establish requirements by
which copyright owners may receive reasonable notice of the use of their
sound recordings under this section, and under which records of such use
shall be kept and made available by entities performing sound recordings. The
notice and recordkeeping rules in effect on the day before the effective date of
the Copyright Royalty and Distribution Reform Act of 2004 shall remain in
effect unless and until new regulations are promulgated by the Copyright Royalty
Judges. If new regulations are promulgated under this subparagraph, the
Copyright Royalty Judges shall take into account the substance and effect of
the rules in effect on the day before the effective date of the Copyright Royalty
and Distribution Reform Act of 2004 and shall, to the extent practicable, avoid
significant disruption of the functions of any designated agent authorized to
collect and distribute royalty fees.
(B) Any person who wishes to perform a sound recording publicly by
means of a transmission eligible for statutory licensing under this subsection
may do so without infringing the exclusive right of the copyright
owner of the sound recording—
(i) by complying with such notice requirements as the Copyright Royalty
Judges shall prescribe by regulation and by paying royalty fees in
accordance with this subsection; or
(ii) if such royalty fees have not been set, by agreeing to pay such
royalty fees as shall be determined in accordance with this subsection.

(C) Any royalty payments in arrears shall be made on or before the twentieth
day of the month next succeeding the month in which the royalty fees
are set.
(5)(A) Notwithstanding section 112(e) and the other provisions of this subsection,
the receiving agent may enter into agreements for the reproduction
and performance of sound recordings under section 112(e) and this section
by any 1 or more commercial webcasters or noncommercial webcasters for
a period of not more than 11 years beginning on January 1, 2005, that, once
published in the Federal Register pursuant to subparagraph (B), shall be binding
on all copyright owners of sound recordings and other persons entitled
to payment under this section, in lieu of any determination by the Copyright
Royalty Judges. Any such agreement for commercial webcasters may
include provisions for payment of royalties on the basis of a percentage of revenue
or expenses, or both, and include a minimum fee. Any such agreement
may include other terms and conditions, including requirements by which
copyright owners may receive notice of the use of their sound recordings and
under which records of such use shall be kept and made available by commercial
webcasters or noncommercial webcasters. The receiving agent shall
be under no obligation to negotiate any such agreement. The receiving agent
shall have no obligation to any copyright owner of sound recordings or any
other person entitled to payment under this section in negotiating any such
agreement, and no liability to any copyright owner of sound recordings or
any other person entitled to payment under this section for having entered
into such agreement.
(B) The Copyright Office shall cause to be published in the Federal Register
any agreement entered into pursuant to subparagraph (A). Such publication
shall include a statement containing the substance of subparagraph
(C). Such agreements shall not be included in the Code of Federal Regulations.
Thereafter, the terms of such agreement shall be available, as an option,
to any commercial webcaster or noncommercial webcaster meeting
the eligibility conditions of such agreement.
(C) Neither subparagraph (A) nor any provisions of any agreement
entered into pursuant to subparagraph (A), including any rate structure,
fees, terms, conditions, or notice and recordkeeping requirements set forth
therein, shall be admissible as evidence or otherwise taken into account in
any administrative, judicial, or other government proceeding involving the
setting or adjustment of the royalties payable for the public performance or
reproduction in ephemeral phonorecords or copies of sound recordings, the
determination of terms or conditions related thereto, or the establishment
of notice or recordkeeping requirements by the Copyright Royalty Judges
under paragraph (4) or section 112(e)(4). It is the intent of Congress that any
royalty rates, rate structure, definitions, terms, conditions, or notice and re-

cordkeeping requirements, included in such agreements shall be considered
as a compromise motivated by the unique business, economic and political
circumstances of webcasters, copyright owners, and performers rather than
as matters that would have been negotiated in the marketplace between a
willing buyer and a willing seller, or otherwise meet the objectives set forth
in section 801(b). This subparagraph shall not apply to the extent that the
receiving agent and a webcaster that is party to an agreement entered into
pursuant to subparagraph (A) expressly authorize the submission of the
agreement in a proceeding under this subsection.
(D) Nothing in the Webcaster Settlement Act of 2008, the Webcaster
Settlement Act of 2009, or any agreement entered into pursuant to subparagraph
(A) shall be taken into account by the United States Court of
Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit in its review of the determination
by the Copyright Royalty Judges of May 1, 2007, of rates and terms
for the digital performance of sound recordings and ephemeral recordings,
pursuant to sections 112 and 114.
(E) As used in this paragraph—
(i) the term “noncommercial webcaster” means a webcaster that—
(I) is exempt from taxation under section 501 of the Internal Revenue
Code of 1986 (26 U.S.C. 501);
(II) has applied in good faith to the Internal Revenue Service for
exemption from taxation under section 501 of the Internal Revenue
Code and has a commercially reasonable expectation that such exemption
shall be granted; or
(III) is operated by a State or possession or any governmental entity
or subordinate thereof, or by the United States or District of Columbia,
for exclusively public purposes;
(ii) the term “receiving agent” shall have the meaning given that term
in section 261.2 of title 37, Code of Federal Regulations, as published in
the Federal Register on July 8, 2002; and
(iii) the term “webcaster” means a person or entity that has obtained a
compulsory license under section 112 or 114 and the implementing regulations
therefor.
(F) The authority to make settlements pursuant to subparagraph (A)
shall expire at 11:59 p.m. Eastern time on the 30th day after the date of the
enactment of the Webcaster Settlement Act of 2009.
(g) Proceeds from Licensing of Transmissions.—

from the copyright owner of the sound recording in accordance with the
terms of the artist’s contract; and
(B) a nonfeatured recording artist who performs on a sound recording
that has been licensed for a transmission shall be entitled to receive payments
from the copyright owner of the sound recording in accordance with
the terms of the nonfeatured recording artist’s applicable contract or other
applicable agreement.
(2) An agent designated to distribute receipts from the licensing of transmissions
in accordance with subsection (f) shall distribute such receipts as follows:

managed by an independent administrator jointly appointed by copyright
owners of sound recordings and the American Federation of Musicians (or
any successor entity) to be distributed to nonfeatured musicians (whether
or not members of the American Federation of Musicians) who have performed
on sound recordings.
(C) 2½ percent of the receipts shall be deposited in an escrow account
managed by an independent administrator jointly appointed by copyright
owners of sound recordings and the American Federation of Television
and Radio Artists (or any successor entity) to be distributed to nonfeatured
vocalists (whether or not members of the American Federation of Television
and Radio Artists) who have performed on sound recordings.
(D) 45 percent of the receipts shall be paid, on a per sound recording
basis, to the recording artist or artists featured on such sound recording
(or the persons conveying rights in the artists’ performance in the sound
recordings).
(3) A nonprofit agent designated to distribute receipts from the licensing
of transmissions in accordance with subsection (f) may deduct from any of
its receipts, prior to the distribution of such receipts to any person or entity
entitled thereto other than copyright owners and performers who have
elected to receive royalties from another designated agent and have notified
such nonprofit agent in writing of such election, the reasonable costs of such
agent incurred after November 1, 1995, in—
(A) the administration of the collection, distribution, and calculation

Copyright Law of the United States 63
Subject Matter and Scope of Copyright §114
negotiations or arbitration proceedings under section 112 and this section,
except that all costs incurred relating to the section 112 ephemeral recordings
right may only be deducted from the royalties received pursuant to
section 112.
(4) Notwithstanding paragraph (3), any designated agent designated to distribute
receipts from the licensing of transmissions in accordance with subsection

after November 1, 1995, with respect to such copyright owners and performers
who have entered with such agent a contractual relationship that specifies that
such costs may be deducted from such royalty receipts.
(h) Licensing to Affiliates.—
(1) If the copyright owner of a sound recording licenses an affiliated entity
the right to publicly perform a sound recording by means of a digital audio
transmission under section 106(6), the copyright owner shall make the licensed
sound recording available under section 106(6) on no less favorable
terms and conditions to all bona fide entities that offer similar services, except
that, if there are material differences in the scope of the requested license with
respect to the type of service, the particular sound recordings licensed, the
frequency of use, the number of subscribers served, or the duration, then the
copyright owner may establish different terms and conditions for such other
services.
(2) The limitation set forth in paragraph (1) of this subsection shall not
apply in the case where the copyright owner of a sound recording licenses—
(A) an interactive service; or
(B) an entity to perform publicly up to 45 seconds of the sound recording
and the sole purpose of the performance is to promote the distribution
or performance of that sound recording.
(i) No Effect on Royalties for Underlying Works.—License fees payable
for the public performance of sound recordings under section 106(6) shall
not be taken into account in any administrative, judicial, or other governmental
proceeding to set or adjust the royalties payable to copyright owners of musical
works for the public performance of their works. It is the intent of Congress
that royalties payable to copyright owners of musical works for the public performance
of their works shall not be diminished in any respect as a result of the
rights granted by section 106(6).
(j) Definitions.—As used in this section, the following terms have the following
meanings:
(1) An “affiliated entity” is an entity engaging in digital audio transmissions
covered by section 106(6), other than an interactive service, in which the licensor
has any direct or indirect partnership or any ownership interest amounting
to 5 percent or more of the outstanding voting or nonvoting stock.
§114
64 Copyright Law of the United States
Subject Matter and Scope of Copyright
(2) An “archived program” is a predetermined program that is available
repeatedly on the demand of the transmission recipient and that is performed
in the same order from the beginning, except that an archived program shall
not include a recorded event or broadcast transmission that makes no more
than an incidental use of sound recordings, as long as such recorded event or
broadcast transmission does not contain an entire sound recording or feature
a particular sound recording.
(3) A “broadcast” transmission is a transmission made by a terrestrial broadcast
station licensed as such by the Federal Communications Commission.
(4) A “continuous program” is a predetermined program that is continuously
performed in the same order and that is accessed at a point in the program
that is beyond the control of the transmission recipient.
(5) A “digital audio transmission” is a digital transmission as defined in section
101, that embodies the transmission of a sound recording. This term does
not include the transmission of any audiovisual work.
(6) An “eligible nonsubscription transmission” is a noninteractive nonsubscription
digital audio transmission not exempt under subsection (d)(1) that
is made as part of a service that provides audio programming consisting, in
whole or in part, of performances of sound recordings, including retransmissions
of broadcast transmissions, if the primary purpose of the service is to
provide to the public such audio or other entertainment programming, and
the primary purpose of the service is not to sell, advertise, or promote particular
products or services other than sound recordings, live concerts, or other
music-related events.
(7) An “interactive service” is one that enables a member of the public to
receive a transmission of a program specially created for the recipient, or on
request, a transmission of a particular sound recording, whether or not as
part of a program, which is selected by or on behalf of the recipient. The ability
of individuals to request that particular sound recordings be performed
for reception by the public at large, or in the case of a subscription service,
by all subscribers of the service, does not make a service interactive, if the
programming on each channel of the service does not substantially consist of
sound recordings that are performed within 1 hour of the request or at a time
designated by either the transmitting entity or the individual making such
request. If an entity offers both interactive and noninteractive services (either
concurrently or at different times), the noninteractive component shall not be
treated as part of an interactive service.
(8) A “new subscription service” is a service that performs sound recordings
by means of noninteractive subscription digital audio transmissions and that
is not a preexisting subscription service or a preexisting satellite digital audio
radio service.
Copyright Law of the United States 65
Subject Matter and Scope of Copyright §114
(9) A “nonsubscription” transmission is any transmission that is not a subscription
transmission.
(10) A “preexisting satellite digital audio radio service” is a subscription
satellite digital audio radio service provided pursuant to a satellite digital audio
radio service license issued by the Federal Communications Commission
on or before July 31, 1998, and any renewal of such license to the extent of the
scope of the original license, and may include a limited number of sample
channels representative of the subscription service that are made available on
a nonsubscription basis in order to promote the subscription service.
(11) A “preexisting subscription service” is a service that performs sound
recordings by means of noninteractive audio-only subscription digital audio
transmissions, which was in existence and was making such transmissions
to the public for a fee on or before July 31, 1998, and may include a limited
number of sample channels representative of the subscription service that are
made available on a nonsubscription basis in order to promote the subscription
service.
(12) A “retransmission” is a further transmission of an initial transmission,
and includes any further retransmission of the same transmission. Except as
provided in this section, a transmission qualifies as a “retransmission” only if
it is simultaneous with the initial transmission. Nothing in this definition shall
be construed to exempt a transmission that fails to satisfy a separate element
required to qualify for an exemption under section 114(d)(1).
(13) The “sound recording performance complement” is the transmission
during any 3-hour period, on a particular channel used by a transmitting
entity, of no more than—
(A) 3 different selections of sound recordings from any one phonorecord
lawfully distributed for public performance or sale in the United States, if
no more than 2 such selections are transmitted consecutively; or
(B) 4 different selections of sound recordings—
(i) by the same featured recording artist; or
(ii) from any set or compilation of phonorecords lawfully distributed
together as a unit for public performance or sale in the United States,
if no more than three such selections are transmitted consecutively:
Provided, That the transmission of selections in excess of the numerical
limits provided for in clauses (A) and (B) from multiple phonorecords shall
nonetheless qualify as a sound recording performance complement if the programming
of the multiple phonorecords was not willfully intended to avoid
the numerical limitations prescribed in such clauses.
(14) A “subscription” transmission is a transmission that is controlled and
limited to particular recipients, and for which consideration is required to be
paid or otherwise given by or on behalf of the recipient to receive the transmission
or a package of transmissions including the transmission.
§115
66 Copyright Law of the United States
Subject Matter and Scope of Copyright
(15) A “transmission” is either an initial transmission or a retransmission.
§115 · Scope of exclusive rights in nondramatic musical works:
Compulsory license for making and distributing
phonorecords50
In the case of nondramatic musical works, the exclusive rights provided by
clauses (1) and (3) of section 106, to make and to distribute phonorecords of such
works, are subject to compulsory licensing under the conditions specified by this
section.
(a) Availability and Scope of Compulsory License.—
(1) When phonorecords of a nondramatic musical work have been distributed
to the public in the United States under the authority of the copyright
owner, any other person, including those who make phonorecords or digital
phonorecord deliveries, may, by complying with the provisions of this section,
obtain a compulsory license to make and distribute phonorecords of the
work. A person may obtain a compulsory license only if his or her primary
purpose in making phonorecords is to distribute them to the public for private
use, including by means of a digital phonorecord delivery. A person may not
obtain a compulsory license for use of the work in the making of phonorecords
duplicating a sound recording fixed by another, unless:
(i) such sound recording was fixed lawfully; and
(ii) the making of the phonorecords was authorized by the owner of
copyright in the sound recording or, if the sound recording was fixed
before February 15, 1972, by any person who fixed the sound recording
pursuant to an express license from the owner of the copyright in the
musical work or pursuant to a valid compulsory license for use of such
work in a sound recording.
(2) A compulsory license includes the privilege of making a musical arrangement
of the work to the extent necessary to conform it to the style or
manner of interpretation of the performance involved, but the arrangement
shall not change the basic melody or fundamental character of the work, and
shall not be subject to protection as a derivative work under this title, except
with the express consent of the copyright owner.
(b) Notice of Intention to Obtain Compulsory License.—
(1) Any person who wishes to obtain a compulsory license under this section
shall, before or within thirty days after making, and before distributing
any phonorecords of the work, serve notice of intention to do so on the
copyright owner. If the registration or other public records of the Copyright
Office do not identify the copyright owner and include an address at which
notice can be served, it shall be sufficient to file the notice of intention in the 
Copyright Law of the United States 67
Subject Matter and Scope of Copyright §115
Copyright Office. The notice shall comply, in form, content, and manner of
service, with requirements that the Register of Copyrights shall prescribe by
regulation.
(2) Failure to serve or file the notice required by clause (1) forecloses the
possibility of a compulsory license and, in the absence of a negotiated license,
renders the making and distribution of phonorecords actionable as acts of
infringement under section 501 and fully subject to the remedies provided by
sections 502 through 506 and 509.
(c) Royalty Payable under Compulsory License.51—
(1) To be entitled to receive royalties under a compulsory license, the copyright
owner must be identified in the registration or other public records of
the Copyright Office. The owner is entitled to royalties for phonorecords made
and distributed after being so identified, but is not entitled to recover for any
phonorecords previously made and distributed.
(2) Except as provided by clause (1), the royalty under a compulsory license
shall be payable for every phonorecord made and distributed in accordance
with the license. For this purpose, and other than as provided in paragraph (3),
a phonorecord is considered “distributed” if the person exercising the
compulsory license has voluntarily and permanently parted with its possession.
With respect to each work embodied in the phonorecord, the royalty shall
be either two and three-fourths cents, or one-half of one cent per minute of
playing time or fraction thereof, whichever amount is larger.
(3)(A) A compulsory license under this section includes the right of the
compulsory licensee to distribute or authorize the distribution of a phonorecord
of a nondramatic musical work by means of a digital transmission which
constitutes a digital phonorecord delivery, regardless of whether the digital
transmission is also a public performance of the sound recording under section
106(6) of this title or of any nondramatic musical work embodied therein
under section 106(4) of this title. For every digital phonorecord delivery by or
under the authority of the compulsory licensee—
(i) on or before December 31, 1997, the royalty payable by the compulsory
licensee shall be the royalty prescribed under paragraph (2) and
chapter 8 of this title; and
(ii) on or after January 1, 1998, the royalty payable by the compulsory
licensee shall be the royalty prescribed under subparagraphs (B) through (E)
and chapter 8 of this title.
(B) Notwithstanding any provision of the antitrust laws, any copyright
owners of nondramatic musical works and any persons entitled to obtain a
compulsory license under subsection (a)(1) may negotiate and agree upon
the terms and rates of royalty payments under this section and the proportionate
division of fees paid among copyright owners, and may designate
common agents on a nonexclusive basis to negotiate, agree to, pay or receive 
§115
68 Copyright Law of the United States
Subject Matter and Scope of Copyright
such royalty payments. Such authority to negotiate the terms and rates of
royalty payments includes, but is not limited to, the authority to negotiate
the year during which the royalty rates prescribed under this subparagraph
and subparagraphs (C) through (E) and chapter 8 of this title shall next be
determined.
(C) Proceedings under chapter 8 shall determine reasonable rates and
terms of royalty payments for the activities specified by this section during
the period beginning with the effective date of such rates and terms, but
not earlier than January 1 of the second year following the year in which
the petition requesting the proceeding is filed, and ending on the effective
date of successor rates and terms, or such other period as the parties may
agree. Such terms and rates shall distinguish between (i) digital phonorecord
deliveries where the reproduction or distribution of a phonorecord
is incidental to the transmission which constitutes the digital phonorecord
delivery, and (ii) digital phonorecord deliveries in general. Any copyright
owners of nondramatic musical works and any persons entitled to obtain
a compulsory license under subsection (a)(1) may submit to the Copyright
Royalty Judges licenses covering such activities. The parties to each proceeding
shall bear their own costs.
(D) The schedule of reasonable rates and terms determined by the
Copyright Royalty Judges shall, subject to subparagraph (E), be binding
on all copyright owners of nondramatic musical works and persons entitled
to obtain a compulsory license under subsection (a)(1) during the
period specified in subparagraph (C), such other period as may be determined
pursuant to subparagraphs (B) and (C), or such other period as
the parties may agree. Such terms and rates shall distinguish between (i)
digital phonorecord deliveries where the reproduction or distribution of a
phonorecord is incidental to the transmission which constitutes the digital
phonorecord delivery, and (ii) digital phonorecord deliveries in general.
In addition to the objectives set forth in section 801(b)(1), in establishing
such rates and terms, the Copyright Royalty Judges may consider rates and
terms under voluntary license agreements described in subparagraphs (B)
and (C). The royalty rates payable for a compulsory license for a digital
phonorecord delivery under this section shall be established de novo and
no precedential effect shall be given to the amount of the royalty payable
by a compulsory licensee for digital phonorecord deliveries on or before
December 31, 1997. The Copyright Royalty Judges shall also establish requirements
by which copyright owners may receive reasonable notice of
the use of their works under this section, and under which records of such
use shall be kept and made available by persons making digital phonorecord
deliveries.
Copyright Law of the United States 69
Subject Matter and Scope of Copyright §115
(E)(i) License agreements voluntarily negotiated at any time between
one or more copyright owners of nondramatic musical works and one or
more persons entitled to obtain a compulsory license under subsection
(a)(1) shall be given effect in lieu of any determination by the Librarian of
Congress and Copyright Royalty Judges. Subject to clause (ii), the royalty
rates determined pursuant to subparagraph (C) and (D) shall be given effect
as to digital phonorecord deliveries in lieu of any contrary royalty
rates specified in a contract pursuant to which a recording artist who is
the author of a nondramatic musical work grants a license under that
person’s exclusive rights in the musical work under paragraphs (1) and (3)
of section 106 or commits another person to grant a license in that musical
work under paragraphs (1) and (3) of section 106, to a person desiring
to fix in a tangible medium of expression a sound recording embodying
the musical work.
(ii) The second sentence of clause (i) shall not apply to—
(I) a contract entered into on or before June 22, 1995 and not
modified thereafter for the purpose of reducing the royalty rates determined
pursuant to subparagraph (C) and (D) or of increasing the
number of musical works within the scope of the contract covered
by the reduced rates, except if a contract entered into on or before
June 22, 1995, is modified thereafter for the purpose of increasing
the number of musical works within the scope of the contract, any
contrary royalty rates specified in the contract shall be given effect in
lieu of royalty rates determined pursuant to subparagraph (C) and (D)
for the number of musical works within the scope of the contract as
of June 22, 1995; and
(II) a contract entered into after the date that the sound recording
is fixed in a tangible medium of expression substantially in a form
intended for commercial release, if at the time the contract is entered
into, the recording artist retains the right to grant licenses as to the
musical work under paragraphs (1) and (3) of section 106.
(F) Except as provided in section 1002(e) of this title, a digital phonorecord
delivery licensed under this paragraph shall be accompanied by
the information encoded in the sound recording, if any, by or under the
authority of the copyright owner of that sound recording, that identifies
the title of the sound recording, the featured recording artist who performs
on the sound recording, and related information, including information
concerning the underlying musical work and its writer.
(G)(i) A digital phonorecord delivery of a sound recording is actionable
as an act of infringement under section 501, and is fully subject to the
remedies provided by sections 502 through 506,52 unless—
§115
70 Copyright Law of the United States
Subject Matter and Scope of Copyright
(I) the digital phonorecord delivery has been authorized by the
copyright owner of the sound recording; and
(II) the owner of the copyright in the sound recording or the entity
making the digital phonorecord delivery has obtained a compulsory
license under this section or has otherwise been authorized by the
copyright owner of the musical work to distribute or authorize the
distribution, by means of a digital phonorecord delivery, of each musical
work embodied in the sound recording.
(ii) Any cause of action under this subparagraph shall be in addition
to those available to the owner of the copyright in the nondramatic
musical work under subsection (c)(6) and section 106(4) and the owner
of the copyright in the sound recording under section 106(6).
(H) The liability of the copyright owner of a sound recording for infringement
of the copyright in a nondramatic musical work embodied in
the sound recording shall be determined in accordance with applicable
law, except that the owner of a copyright in a sound recording shall not
be liable for a digital phonorecord delivery by a third party if the owner of
the copyright in the sound recording does not license the distribution of a
phonorecord of the nondramatic musical work.
(I) Nothing in section 1008 shall be construed to prevent the exercise
of the rights and remedies allowed by this paragraph, paragraph (6), and
chapter 5 in the event of a digital phonorecord delivery, except that no
action alleging infringement of copyright may be brought under this title
against a manufacturer, importer or distributor of a digital audio recording
device, a digital audio recording medium, an analog recording device, or
an analog recording medium, or against a consumer, based on the actions
described in such section.
(J) Nothing in this section annuls or limits
(i) the exclusive right to publicly perform a sound recording or the
musical work embodied therein, including by means of a digital transmission,
under sections 106(4) and 106(6), (ii) except for compulsory
licensing under the conditions specified by this section, the exclusive
rights to reproduce and distribute the sound recording and the musical
work embodied therein under sections 106(1) and 106(3), including
by means of a digital phonorecord delivery, or (iii) any other rights
under any other provision of section 106, or remedies available under
this title, as such rights or remedies exist either before or after the date
of enactment of the Digital Performance Right in Sound Recordings
Act of 1995.
(K) The provisions of this section concerning digital phonorecord deliveries
shall not apply to any exempt transmissions or retransmissions under
section 114(d)(1). The exemptions created in section 114(d)(1) do not expand 
Copyright Law of the United States 71
Subject Matter and Scope of Copyright §115
or reduce the rights of copyright owners under section 106(1) through (5)
with respect to such transmissions and retransmissions.
(4) A compulsory license under this section includes the right of the maker
of a phonorecord of a nondramatic musical work under subsection (a)(1) to
distribute or authorize distribution of such phonorecord by rental, lease, or
lending (or by acts or practices in the nature of rental, lease, or lending). In
addition to any royalty payable under clause (2) and chapter 8 of this title, a
royalty shall be payable by the compulsory licensee for every act of distribution
of a phonorecord by or in the nature of rental, lease, or lending, by or under
the authority of the compulsory licensee. With respect to each nondramatic
musical work embodied in the phonorecord, the royalty shall be a proportion
of the revenue received by the compulsory licensee from every such act
of distribution of the phonorecord under this clause equal to the proportion
of the revenue received by the compulsory licensee from distribution of the
phonorecord under clause (2) that is payable by a compulsory licensee under
that clause and under chapter 8. The Register of Copyrights shall issue regulations
to carry out the purpose of this clause.
(5) Royalty payments shall be made on or before the twentieth day of each
month and shall include all royalties for the month next preceding. Each
monthly payment shall be made under oath and shall comply with requirements
that the Register of Copyrights shall prescribe by regulation. The Register
shall also prescribe regulations under which detailed cumulative annual
statements of account, certified by a certified public accountant, shall be filed
for every compulsory license under this section. The regulations covering both
the monthly and the annual statements of account shall prescribe the form,
content, and manner of certification with respect to the number of records
made and the number of records distributed.
(6) If the copyright owner does not receive the monthly payment and the
monthly and annual statements of account when due, the owner may give
written notice to the licensee that, unless the default is remedied within thirty
days from the date of the notice, the compulsory license will be automatically
terminated. Such termination renders either the making or the distribution, or
both, of all phonorecords for which the royalty has not been paid, actionable
as acts of infringement under section 501 and fully subject to the remedies
provided by sections 502 through 506.
(d) Definition.—As used in this section, the following term has the following
meaning: A “digital phonorecord delivery” is each individual delivery
of a phonorecord by digital transmission of a sound recording which results in
a specifically identifiable reproduction by or for any transmission recipient of
a phonorecord of that sound recording, regardless of whether the digital transmission
is also a public performance of the sound recording or any nondramatic
musical work embodied therein. A digital phonorecord delivery does not 
§116
72 Copyright Law of the United States
Subject Matter and Scope of Copyright
result from a real-time, non-interactive subscription transmission of a sound
recording where no reproduction of the sound recording or the musical work
embodied therein is made from the inception of the transmission through to
its receipt by the transmission recipient in order to make the sound recording
audible.
§116 · Negotiated licenses for public performances by means of
coin-operated phonorecord players53
(a) Applicability of Section.—This section applies to any nondramatic
musical work embodied in a phonorecord.
(b) Negotiated Licenses.—

to which this section applies and any operators of coin-operated phonorecord
players may negotiate and agree upon the terms and rates of royalty payments
for the performance of such works and the proportionate division of fees paid
among copyright owners, and may designate common agents to negotiate,
agree to, pay, or receive such royalty payments.
(2) Chapter 8 proceeding.—Parties not subject to such a negotiation
may have the terms and rates and the division of fees described in paragraph
(1) determined in a proceeding in accordance with the provisions of chapter 8.
(c) License Agreements Superior to Determinations by Copyright
Royalty Judges.—License agreements between one or more copyright owners
and one or more operators of coin-operated phonorecord players, which are
negotiated in accordance with subsection (b), shall be given effect in lieu of any
otherwise applicable determination by the Copyright Royalty Judges.
(d) Definitions.—As used in this section, the following terms mean the
following:
(1) A “coin-operated phonorecord player” is a machine or device that—
(A) is employed solely for the performance of nondramatic musical
works by means of phonorecords upon being activated by the insertion of
coins, currency, tokens, or other monetary units or their equivalent;
(B) is located in an establishment making no direct or indirect charge
for admission;
(C) is accompanied by a list which is comprised of the titles of all the
musical works available for performance on it, and is affixed to the phonorecord
player or posted in the establishment in a prominent position where
it can be readily examined by the public; and
(D) affords a choice of works available for performance and permits
the choice to be made by the patrons of the establishment in which it is
located.

§117 · Limitations on exclusive rights: Computer programs54
(a) Making of Additional Copy or Adaptation by Owner of Copy.—
Notwithstanding the provisions of section 106, it is not an infringement for the
owner of a copy of a computer program to make or authorize the making of
another copy or adaptation of that computer program provided:
(1) that such a new copy or adaptation is created as an essential step in the
utilization of the computer program in conjunction with a machine and that
it is used in no other manner, or
(2) that such new copy or adaptation is for archival purposes only and that
all archival copies are destroyed in the event that continued possession of the
computer program should cease to be rightful.
(b) Lease, Sale, or Other Transfer of Additional Copy or Adaptation.—Any
exact copies prepared in accordance with the provisions of this
section may be leased, sold, or otherwise transferred, along with the copy from
which such copies were prepared, only as part of the lease, sale, or other transfer
of all rights in the program. Adaptations so prepared may be transferred only
with the authorization of the copyright owner.
(c) Machine Maintenance or Repair.—Notwithstanding the provisions
of section 106, it is not an infringement for the owner or lessee of a machine to
make or authorize the making of a copy of a computer program if such copy is
made solely by virtue of the activation of a machine that lawfully contains an
authorized copy of the computer program, for purposes only of maintenance or
repair of that machine, if—
(1) such new copy is used in no other manner and is destroyed immediately
after the maintenance or repair is completed; and
(2) with respect to any computer program or part thereof that is not necessary
for that machine to be activated, such program or part thereof is not
accessed or used other than to make such new copy by virtue of the activation
of the machine.
(d) Definitions.—For purposes of this section—
§118
74 Copyright Law of the United States
Subject Matter and Scope of Copyright

to make it work in accordance with its original specifications and any changes
to those specifications authorized for that machine; and
(2) the “repair” of a machine is the restoring of the machine to the state of
working in accordance with its original specifications and any changes to those
specifications authorized for that machine.
§118 · Scope of exclusive rights: Use of certain works
in connection with noncommercial broadcasting55

specified by subsection (b) and the activities specified by subsection (d), be subject
to the conditions and limitations prescribed by this section.
(b) Notwithstanding any provision of the antitrust laws, any owners of copyright
in published nondramatic musical works and published pictorial, graphic,
and sculptural works and any public broadcasting entities, respectively, may negotiate
and agree upon the terms and rates of royalty payments and the proportionate
division of fees paid among various copyright owners, and may designate
common agents to negotiate, agree to, pay, or receive payments.
(1) Any owner of copyright in a work specified in this subsection or any
public broadcasting entity may submit to the Copyright Royalty Judges proposed
licenses covering such activities with respect to such works.
(2) License agreements voluntarily negotiated at any time between one or
more copyright owners and one or more public broadcasting entities shall

126 Copyright Law of the United States
§201 Copyright Ownership and Transfer
§201 · Ownership of copyright1
(a) Initial Ownership.—Copyright in a work protected under this title
vests initially in the author or authors of the work. The authors of a joint work
are coowners of copyright in the work.
(b) Works Made for Hire.—In the case of a work made for hire, the employer
or other person for whom the work was prepared is considered the author
for purposes of this title, and, unless the parties have expressly agreed otherwise
in a written instrument signed by them, owns all of the rights comprised in the
copyright.
(c) Contributions to Collective Works.—Copyright in each separate
contribution to a collective work is distinct from copyright in the collective work
as a whole, and vests initially in the author of the contribution. In the absence
of an express transfer of the copyright or of any rights under it, the owner of
copyright in the collective work is presumed to have acquired only the privilege
of reproducing and distributing the contribution as part of that particular collective
work, any revision of that collective work, and any later collective work
in the same series.
(d) Transfer of Ownership.—
(1) The ownership of a copyright may be transferred in whole or in part by
any means of conveyance or by operation of law, and may be bequeathed by
will or pass as personal property by the applicable laws of intestate succession.
(2) Any of the exclusive rights comprised in a copyright, including any
subdivision of any of the rights specified by section 106, may be transferred
as provided by clause (1) and owned separately. The owner of any particular
exclusive right is entitled, to the extent of that right, to all of the protection
and remedies accorded to the copyright owner by this title.
(e) Involuntary Transfer.—When an individual author’s ownership of a
copyright, or of any of the exclusive rights under a copyright, has not previously
been transferred voluntarily by that individual author, no action by any governmental
body or other official or organization purporting to seize, expropriate,
transfer, or exercise rights of ownership with respect to the copyright, or any of
the exclusive rights under a copyright, shall be given effect under this title, except
as provided under title 11.2
§202 · Ownership of copyright as distinct from ownership
of material object
Ownership of a copyright, or of any of the exclusive rights under a copyright,
is distinct from ownership of any material object in which the work is embodied.
Transfer of ownership of any material object, including the copy or phonorecord 
Copyright Law of the United States 127
Copyright Ownership and Transfer §203
in which the work is first fixed, does not of itself convey any rights in the copyrighted
work embodied in the object; nor, in the absence of an agreement, does
transfer of ownership of a copyright or of any exclusive rights under a copyright
convey property rights in any material object.
§203 · Termination of transfers and licenses granted by the author3
(a) Conditions for Termination.—In the case of any work other than a
work made for hire, the exclusive or nonexclusive grant of a transfer or license of
copyright or of any right under a copyright, executed by the author on or after
January 1, 1978, otherwise than by will, is subject to termination under the following
conditions:
(1) In the case of a grant executed by one author, termination of the grant
may be effected by that author or, if the author is dead, by the person or persons
who, under clause (2) of this subsection, own and are entitled to exercise
a total of more than one-half of that author’s termination interest. In the
case of a grant executed by two or more authors of a joint work, termination
of the grant may be effected by a majority of the authors who executed it; if
any of such authors is dead, the termination interest of any such author may
be exercised as a unit by the person or persons who, under clause (2) of this
subsection, own and are entitled to exercise a total of more than one-half of
that author’s interest.
(2) Where an author is dead, his or her termination interest is owned, and
may be exercised, as follows:
(A) The widow or widower owns the author’s entire termination interest
unless there are any surviving children or grandchildren of the author, in
which case the widow or widower owns one-half of the author’s interest.
(B) The author’s surviving children, and the surviving children of any
dead child of the author, own the author’s entire termination interest unless
there is a widow or widower, in which case the ownership of one-half of the
author’s interest is divided among them.
(C) The rights of the author’s children and grandchildren are in all cases
divided among them and exercised on a per stirpes basis according to the
number of such author’s children represented; the share of the children of
a dead child in a termination interest can be exercised only by the action
of a majority of them.
(D) In the event that the author’s widow or widower, children, and grandchildren
are not living, the author’s executor, administrator, personal representative,
or trustee shall own the author’s entire termination interest.
(3) Termination of the grant may be effected at any time during a period of
five years beginning at the end of thirty-five years from the date of execution 
128 Copyright Law of the United States
§203 Copyright Ownership and Transfer
of the grant; or, if the grant covers the right of publication of the work, the
period begins at the end of thirty-five years from the date of publication of the
work under the grant or at the end of forty years from the date of execution of
the grant, whichever term ends earlier.
(4) The termination shall be effected by serving an advance notice in writing,
signed by the number and proportion of owners of termination interests
required under clauses (1) and (2) of this subsection, or by their duly authorized
agents, upon the grantee or the grantee’s successor in title.
(A) The notice shall state the effective date of the termination, which
shall fall within the five-year period specified by clause (3) of this subsection,
and the notice shall be served not less than two or more than ten years before
that date. A copy of the notice shall be recorded in the Copyright Office
before the effective date of termination, as a condition to its taking effect.
(B) The notice shall comply, in form, content, and manner of service, with
requirements that the Register of Copyrights shall prescribe by regulation.
(5) Termination of the grant may be effected notwithstanding any agreement
to the contrary, including an agreement to make a will or to make any
future grant.
(b) Effect of Termination.—Upon the effective date of termination, all
rights under this title that were covered by the terminated grants revert to the
author, authors, and other persons owning termination interests under clauses
(1) and (2) of subsection (a), including those owners who did not join in signing
the notice of termination under clause (4) of subsection (a), but with the following
limitations:
(1) A derivative work prepared under authority of the grant before its termination
may continue to be utilized under the terms of the grant after its
termination, but this privilege does not extend to the preparation after the
termination of other derivative works based upon the copyrighted work covered
by the terminated grant.
(2) The future rights that will revert upon termination of the grant become
vested on the date the notice of termination has been served as provided by
clause (4) of subsection (a). The rights vest in the author, authors, and other
persons named in, and in the proportionate shares provided by, clauses (1) and
(2) of subsection (a).
(3) Subject to the provisions of clause (4) of this subsection, a further grant,
or agreement to make a further grant, of any right covered by a terminated
grant is valid only if it is signed by the same number and proportion of the
owners, in whom the right has vested under clause (2) of this subsection, as
are required to terminate the grant under clauses (1) and (2) of subsection (a).
Such further grant or agreement is effective with respect to all of the persons in
whom the right it covers has vested under clause (2) of this subsection, including
those who did not join in signing it. If any person dies after rights under a 
Copyright Law of the United States 129
Copyright Ownership and Transfer §205
terminated grant have vested in him or her, that person’s legal representatives,
legatees, or heirs at law represent him or her for purposes of this clause.
(4) A further grant, or agreement to make a further grant, of any right
covered by a terminated grant is valid only if it is made after the effective date
of the termination. As an exception, however, an agreement for such a further
grant may be made between the persons provided by clause (3) of this subsection
and the original grantee or such grantee’s successor in title, after the notice
of termination has been served as provided by clause (4) of subsection (a).
(5) Termination of a grant under this section affects only those rights covered
by the grants that arise under this title, and in no way affects rights arising
under any other Federal, State, or foreign laws.
(6) Unless and until termination is effected under this section, the grant,
if it does not provide otherwise, continues in effect for the term of copyright
provided by this title.
§204 · Execution of transfers of copyright ownership
(a) A transfer of copyright ownership, other than by operation of law, is not
valid unless an instrument of conveyance, or a note or memorandum of the
transfer, is in writing and signed by the owner of the rights conveyed or such
owner’s duly authorized agent.
(b) A certificate of acknowledgment is not required for the validity of a transfer,
but is prima facie evidence of the execution of the transfer if—
(1) in the case of a transfer executed in the United States, the certificate is issued
by a person authorized to administer oaths within the United States; or
(2) in the case of a transfer executed in a foreign country, the certificate is
issued by a diplomatic or consular officer of the United States, or by a person
authorized to administer oaths whose authority is proved by a certificate of
such an officer.
§205 · Recordation of transfers and other documents4
(a) Conditions for Recordation.—Any transfer of copyright ownership
or other document pertaining to a copyright may be recorded in the Copyright
Office if the document filed for recordation bears the actual signature of the person
who executed it, or if it is accompanied by a sworn or official certification that
it is a true copy of the original, signed document. A sworn or official certification
may be submitted to the Copyright Office electronically, pursuant to regulations
established by the Register of Copyrights.
130 Copyright Law of the United States
Notes Copyright Ownership and Transfer
(b) Certificate of Recordation.—The Register of Copyrights shall, upon
receipt of a document as provided by subsection (a) and of the fee provided by
section 708, record the document and return it with a certificate of recordation.
(c) Recordation as Constructive Notice.—Recordation of a document
in the Copyright Office gives all persons constructive notice of the facts stated in
the recorded document, but only if—
(1) the document, or material attached to it, specifically identifies the work
to which it pertains so that, after the document is indexed by the Register of
Copyrights, it would be revealed by a reasonable search under the title or registration
number of the work; and
(2) registration has been made for the work.
(d) Priority between Conflicting Transfers.—As between two conflicting
transfers, the one executed first prevails if it is recorded, in the manner
required to give constructive notice under subsection (c), within one month
after its execution in the United States or within two months after its execution
outside the United States, or at any time before recordation in such manner of
the later transfer. Otherwise the later transfer prevails if recorded first in such
manner, and if taken in good faith, for valuable consideration or on the basis
of a binding promise to pay royalties, and without notice of the earlier transfer.
(e) Priority between Conflicting Transfer of Ownership and
Nonexclusive License.—A nonexclusive license, whether recorded or not,
prevails over a conflicting transfer of copyright ownership if the license is evidenced
by a written instrument signed by the owner of the rights licensed or such
owner’s duly authorized agent, and if
(1) the license was taken before execution of the transfer; or
(2) the license was taken in good faith before recordation of the transfer
and without notice of it.

§302 · Duration of copyright:
Works created on or after January 1, 19784
(a) In General.—Copyright in a work created on or after January 1, 1978,
subsists from its creation and, except as provided by the following subsections,
endures for a term consisting of the life of the author and 70 years after the
author’s death.
(b) Joint Works.—In the case of a joint work prepared by two or more authors
who did not work for hire, the copyright endures for a term consisting of the
life of the last surviving author and 70 years after such last surviving author’s death.
(c) Anonymous Works, Pseudonymous Works, and Works Made for
Hire.—In the case of an anonymous work, a pseudonymous work, or a work
made for hire, the copyright endures for a term of 95 years from the year of its
first publication, or a term of 120 years from the year of its creation, whichever
expires first. If, before the end of such term, the identity of one or more of the
authors of an anonymous or pseudonymous work is revealed in the records of
a registration made for that work under subsections (a) or (d) of section 408, or
in the records provided by this subsection, the copyright in the work endures
for the term specified by subsection (a) or (b), based on the life of the author or
authors whose identity has been revealed. Any person having an interest in the
copyright in an anonymous or pseudonymous work may at any time record, in
records to be maintained by the Copyright Office for that purpose, a statement
identifying one or more authors of the work; the statement shall also identify the
person filing it, the nature of that person’s interest, the source of the information
recorded, and the particular work affected, and shall comply in form and content
with requirements that the Register of Copyrights shall prescribe by regulation.
(d) Records Relating to Death of Authors.—Any person having an
interest in a copyright may at any time record in the Copyright Office a statement
of the date of death of the author of the copyrighted work, or a statement
that the author is still living on a particular date. The statement shall identify
the person filing it, the nature of that person’s interest, and the source of the 
134 Copyright Law of the United States
§303 Duration of Copyright
information recorded, and shall comply in form and content with requirements
that the Register of Copyrights shall prescribe by regulation. The Register shall
maintain current records of information relating to the death of authors of copyrighted
works, based on such recorded statements and, to the extent the Register
considers practicable, on data contained in any of the records of the Copyright
Office or in other reference sources.
(e) Presumption as to Author’s Death.—After a period of 95 years from
the year of first publication of a work, or a period of 120 years from the year of its
creation, whichever expires first, any person who obtains from the Copyright Office
a certified report that the records provided by subsection (d) disclose nothing
to indicate that the author of the work is living, or died less than 70 years before,
is entitled to the benefit of a presumption that the author has been dead for at
least 70 years. Reliance in good faith upon this presumption shall be a complete
defense to any action for infringement under this title.
§303 · Duration of copyright: Works created but not published
or copyrighted before January 1, 19785
(a) Copyright in a work created before January 1, 1978, but not theretofore in
the public domain or copyrighted, subsists from January 1, 1978, and endures for
the term provided by section 302. In no case, however, shall the term of copyright
in such a work expire before December 31, 2002; and, if the work is published
on or before December 31, 2002, the term of copyright shall not expire before
December 31, 2047.
(b) The distribution before January 1, 1978, of a phonorecord shall not for any
purpose constitute a publication of any musical work, dramatic work, or literary
work embodied therein.

(a) Copyrights in Their First Term on January 1, 1978.—
(1)(A) Any copyright, in the first term of which is subsisting on January 1,
1978, shall endure for 28 years from the date it was originally secured.
(B) In the case of—
(i) any posthumous work or of any periodical, cyclopedic, or other
composite work upon which the copyright was originally secured by the
proprietor thereof, or
(ii) any work copyrighted by a corporate body (otherwise than as assignee
or licensee of the individual author) or by an employer for whom
such work is made for hire,
Copyright Law of the United States 135
Duration of Copyright §304
the proprietor of such copyright shall be entitled to a renewal and extension
of the copyright in such work for the further term of 67 years.
(C) In the case of any other copyrighted work, including a contribution
by an individual author to a periodical or to a cyclopedic or other composite
work—
(i) the author of such work, if the author is still living,
(ii) the widow, widower, or children of the author, if the author is
not living,
(iii) the author’s executors, if such author, widow, widower, or children
are not living, or
(iv) the author’s next of kin, in the absence of a will of the author,
shall be entitled to a renewal and extension of the copyright in such work for
a further term of 67 years.
(2)(A) At the expiration of the original term of copyright in a work specified
in paragraph (1)(B) of this subsection, the copyright shall endure for a renewed
and extended further term of 67 years, which—
(i) if an application to register a claim to such further term has been
made to the Copyright Office within 1 year before the expiration of the
original term of copyright, and the claim is registered, shall vest, upon
the beginning of such further term, in the proprietor of the copyright
who is entitled to claim the renewal of copyright at the time the application
is made; or
(ii) if no such application is made or the claim pursuant to such application
is not registered, shall vest, upon the beginning of such further
term, in the person or entity that was the proprietor of the copyright as
of the last day of the original term of copyright.
(B) At the expiration of the original term of copyright in a work specified
in paragraph (1)(C) of this subsection, the copyright shall endure for a
renewed and extended further term of 67 years, which—
(i) if an application to register a claim to such further term has been
made to the Copyright Office within 1 year before the expiration of the
original term of copyright, and the claim is registered, shall vest, upon
the beginning of such further term, in any person who is entitled under
paragraph (1)(C) to the renewal and extension of the copyright at the
time the application is made; or
(ii) if no such application is made or the claim pursuant to such application
is not registered, shall vest, upon the beginning of such further
term, in any person entitled under paragraph (1)(C), as of the last day
of the original term of copyright, to the renewal and extension of the
copyright.
(3)(A) An application to register a claim to the renewed and extended term
of copyright in a work may be made to the Copyright Office—
136 Copyright Law of the United States
§304 Duration of Copyright
(i) within 1 year before the expiration of the original term of copyright
by any person entitled under paragraph (1)(B) or (C) to such further
term of 67 years; and
(ii) at any time during the renewed and extended term by any person
in whom such further term vested, under paragraph (2)(A) or (B), or by
any successor or assign of such person, if the application is made in the
name of such person.
(B) Such an application is not a condition of the renewal and extension
of the copyright in a work for a further term of 67 years.
(4)(A) If an application to register a claim to the renewed and extended
term of copyright in a work is not made within 1 year before the expiration
of the original term of copyright in a work, or if the claim pursuant to such
application is not registered, then a derivative work prepared under authority
of a grant of a transfer or license of the copyright that is made before the
expiration of the original term of copyright may continue to be used under
the terms of the grant during the renewed and extended term of copyright
without infringing the copyright, except that such use does not extend to the
preparation during such renewed and extended term of other derivative works
based upon the copyrighted work covered by such grant.
(B) If an application to register a claim to the renewed and extended
term of copyright in a work is made within 1 year before its expiration, and
the claim is registered, the certificate of such registration shall constitute
prima facie evidence as to the validity of the copyright during its renewed
and extended term and of the facts stated in the certificate. The evidentiary
weight to be accorded the certificates of a registration of a renewed and
extended term of copyright made after the end of that 1-year period shall
be within the discretion of the court.
(b) Copyrights in Their Renewal Term at the Time of the Effective
Date of the Sonny Bono Copyright Term Extension Act7—Any
copyright still in its renewal term at the time that the Sonny Bono Copyright
Term Extension Act becomes effective shall have a copyright term of 95 years
from the date copyright was originally secured.⁸
(c) Termination of Transfers and Licenses Covering Extended
Renewal Term.—In the case of any copyright subsisting in either its first or
renewal term on January 1, 1978, other than a copyright in a work made for
hire, the exclusive or nonexclusive grant of a transfer or license of the renewal
copyright or any right under it, executed before January 1, 1978, by any of the
persons designated by subsection (a)(1)(C) of this section, otherwise than by
will, is subject to termination under the following conditions:
(1) In the case of a grant executed by a person or persons other than the
author, termination of the grant may be effected by the surviving person or
persons who executed it. In the case of a grant executed by one or more of the 
Copyright Law of the United States 137
Duration of Copyright §304
authors of the work, termination of the grant may be effected, to the extent of
a particular author’s share in the ownership of the renewal copyright, by the
author who executed it or, if such author is dead, by the person or persons who,
under clause (2) of this subsection, own and are entitled to exercise a total of
more than one-half of that author’s termination interest.
(2) Where an author is dead, his or her termination interest is owned, and
may be exercised, as follows:
(A) The widow or widower owns the author’s entire termination interest
unless there are any surviving children or grandchildren of the author, in
which case the widow or widower owns one-half of the author’s interest.
(B) The author’s surviving children, and the surviving children of any
dead child of the author, own the author’s entire termination interest unless
there is a widow or widower, in which case the ownership of one-half of the
author’s interest is divided among them.
(C) The rights of the author’s children and grandchildren are in all cases
divided among them and exercised on a per stirpes basis according to the
number of such author’s children represented; the share of the children of
a dead child in a termination interest can be exercised only by the action
of a majority of them.
(D) In the event that the author’s widow or widower, children, and grandchildren
are not living, the author’s executor, administrator, personal representative,
or trustee shall own the author’s entire termination interest.
(3) Termination of the grant may be effected at any time during a period of
five years beginning at the end of fifty-six years from the date copyright was
originally secured, or beginning on January 1, 1978, whichever is later.
(4) The termination shall be effected by serving an advance notice in writing
upon the grantee or the grantee’s successor in title. In the case of a grant
executed by a person or persons other than the author, the notice shall be
signed by all of those entitled to terminate the grant under clause (1) of this
subsection, or by their duly authorized agents. In the case of a grant executed
by one or more of the authors of the work, the notice as to any one author’s
share shall be signed by that author or his or her duly authorized agent or, if
that author is dead, by the number and proportion of the owners of his or her
termination interest required under clauses (1) and (2) of this subsection, or
by their duly authorized agents.
(A) The notice shall state the effective date of the termination, which
shall fall within the five-year period specified by clause (3) of this subsection,
or, in the case of a termination under subsection (d), within the five-year
period specified by subsection (d)(2), and the notice shall be served not less
than two or more than ten years before that date. A copy of the notice shall
be recorded in the Copyright Office before the effective date of termination,
as a condition to its taking effect.
138 Copyright Law of the United States
§304 Duration of Copyright
(B) The notice shall comply, in form, content, and manner of service, with
requirements that the Register of Copyrights shall prescribe by regulation.
(5) Termination of the grant may be effected notwithstanding any agreement
to the contrary, including an agreement to make a will or to make any
future grant.
(6) In the case of a grant executed by a person or persons other than the author,
all rights under this title that were covered by the terminated grant revert,
upon the effective date of termination, to all of those entitled to terminate the
grant under clause (1) of this subsection. In the case of a grant executed by one
or more of the authors of the work, all of a particular author’s rights under
this title that were covered by the terminated grant revert, upon the effective
date of termination, to that author or, if that author is dead, to the persons
owning his or her termination interest under clause (2) of this subsection,
including those owners who did not join in signing the notice of termination
under clause (4) of this subsection. In all cases the reversion of rights is subject
to the following limitations:
(A) A derivative work prepared under authority of the grant before its
termination may continue to be utilized under the terms of the grant after
its termination, but this privilege does not extend to the preparation after
the termination of other derivative works based upon the copyrighted work
covered by the terminated grant.
(B) The future rights that will revert upon termination of the grant become
vested on the date the notice of termination has been served as provided
by clause (4) of this subsection.
(C) Where the author’s rights revert to two or more persons under clause
(2) of this subsection, they shall vest in those persons in the proportionate
shares provided by that clause. In such a case, and subject to the provisions
of subclause (D) of this clause, a further grant, or agreement to make a further
grant, of a particular author’s share with respect to any right covered
by a terminated grant is valid only if it is signed by the same number and
proportion of the owners, in whom the right has vested under this clause,
as are required to terminate the grant under clause (2) of this subsection.
Such further grant or agreement is effective with respect to all of the persons
in whom the right it covers has vested under this subclause, including
those who did not join in signing it. If any person dies after rights under
a terminated grant have vested in him or her, that person’s legal representatives,
legatees, or heirs at law represent him or her for purposes of this
subclause.
(D) A further grant, or agreement to make a further grant, of any right
covered by a terminated grant is valid only if it is made after the effective
date of the termination. As an exception, however, an agreement for such
a further grant may be made between the author or any of the persons 
Copyright Law of the United States 139
Duration of Copyright
provided by the first sentence of clause (6) of this subsection, or between the
persons provided by subclause (C) of this clause, and the original grantee
or such grantee’s successor in title, after the notice of termination has been
served as provided by clause (4) of this subsection.
(E) Termination of a grant under this subsection affects only those rights
covered by the grant that arise under this title, and in no way affects rights
arising under any other Federal, State, or foreign laws.
(F) Unless and until termination is effected under this subsection, the
grant, if it does not provide otherwise, continues in effect for the remainder
of the extended renewal term.
(d) Termination Rights Provided in Subsection (c) Which Have
Expired on or before the Effective Date of the Sonny Bono Copyright
Term Extension Act.—In the case of any copyright other than a work
made for hire, subsisting in its renewal term on the effective date of the Sonny
Bono Copyright Term Extension Act9 for which the termination right provided
in subsection (c) has expired by such date, where the author or owner of the termination
right has not previously exercised such termination right, the exclusive
or nonexclusive grant of a transfer or license of the renewal copyright or any
right under it, executed before January 1, 1978, by any of the persons designated
in subsection (a)(1)(C) of this section, other than by will, is subject to termination
under the following conditions:
(1) The conditions specified in subsections (c) (1), (2), (4), (5), and (6) of this
section apply to terminations of the last 20 years of copyright term as provided
by the amendments made by the Sonny Bono Copyright Term Extension Act.
(2) Termination of the grant may be effected at any time during a period of
5 years beginning at the end of 75 years from the date copyright was originally
secured.
§305 · Duration of copyright: Terminal date
All terms of copyright provided by sections 302 through 304 run to the end of
the calendar year in which they would otherwise expire.

304(b) completely deleted the previous language that was originally part of the 1976 Copyright
Act. Pub. L. No. 105-298, 112 Stat. 2827. That earlier statutory language continues
to be relevant for calculating the term of protection for copyrights commencing between
September 19, 1906, and December 31, 1949. The 1976 Copyright Act extended the terms for
those copyrights by 20 years, provided they were in their renewal term between December
31, 1976, and December 31, 1977. The deleted language states:
The duration of any copyright, the renewal term of which is subsisting at any time between
December 31, 1976, and December 31, 1977, inclusive, or for which renewal registration
is made between December 31, 1976, and December 31, 1977, inclusive, is extended to endure
for a term of seventy-five years from the date copyright was originally secured.
The effective date of this provision was October 19, 1976. That effective date provision
is contained in Appendix A, herein, as section 102 of the Transitional and Supplementary
Provisions of the Copyright Act of 1976. Copyright Act of 1976, Pub. L. No. 94-553, 90 Stat.
2541, 2598.
In addition, prior to the 1976 Copyright Act, Congress enacted a series of nine interim
extensions for works whose copyright protection began between September 19, 1906, and
December 31, 1920, if they were in their renewal terms. Without these interim extensions,
copyrights commencing during that time period would have otherwise expired after 56 years,
at the end of their renewal terms, between September 19, 1962, and December 31, 1976. The
nine Acts authorizing the interim extensions are as follows, in chronological order:
Pub. L. No. 87-668, 76 Stat. 555 (extending copyrights from September 19, 1962, to December
31, 1965)

144 Copyright Law of the United States
§401 Copyright Notice, Deposit, and Registration
§401 · Notice of copyright: Visually perceptible copies2
(a) General Provisions.—Whenever a work protected under this title is
published in the United States or elsewhere by authority of the copyright owner,
a notice of copyright as provided by this section may be placed on publicly distributed
copies from which the work can be visually perceived, either directly or
with the aid of a machine or device.
(b) Form of Notice.—If a notice appears on the copies, it shall consist of
the following three elements:
(1) the symbol © (the letter C in a circle), or the word “Copyright”, or the
abbreviation “Copr.”; and
(2) the year of first publication of the work; in the case of compilations or
derivative works incorporating previously published material, the year date of
first publication of the compilation or derivative work is sufficient. The year
date may be omitted where a pictorial, graphic, or sculptural work, with accompanying
text matter, if any, is reproduced in or on greeting cards, postcards,
stationery, jewelry, dolls, toys, or any useful articles; and
(3) the name of the owner of copyright in the work, or an abbreviation by
which the name can be recognized, or a generally known alternative designation
of the owner.
(c) Position of Notice.—The notice shall be affixed to the copies in such
manner and location as to give reasonable notice of the claim of copyright. The
Register of Copyrights shall prescribe by regulation, as examples, specific methods
of affixation and positions of the notice on various types of works that will satisfy
this requirement, but these specifications shall not be considered exhaustive.
(d) Evidentiary Weight of Notice.—If a notice of copyright in the form
and position specified by this section appears on the published copy or copies to
which a defendant in a copyright infringement suit had access, then no weight
shall be given to such a defendant’s interposition of a defense based on innocent
infringement in mitigation of actual or statutory damages, except as provided in
the last sentence of section 504(c)(2).
§402 · Notice of copyright: Phonorecords of sound recordings3
(a) General Provisions.—Whenever a sound recording protected under
this title is published in the United States or elsewhere by authority of the copyright
owner, a notice of copyright as provided by this section may be placed on
publicly distributed phonorecords of the sound recording.
(b) Form of Notice.—If a notice appears on the phonorecords, it shall consist
of the following three elements:
(1) the symbol π (the letter P in a circle); and
Copyright Law of the United States 145
Copyright Notice, Deposit, and Registration §404
(2) the year of first publication of the sound recording; and
(3) the name of the owner of copyright in the sound recording, or an abbreviation
by which the name can be recognized, or a generally known alternative
designation of the owner; if the producer of the sound recording is named
on the phonorecord labels or containers, and if no other name appears in
conjunction with the notice, the producer’s name shall be considered a part
of the notice.
(c) Position of Notice.—The notice shall be placed on the surface of the
phonorecord, or on the phonorecord label or container, in such manner and
location as to give reasonable notice of the claim of copyright.
(d) Evidentiary Weight of Notice.—If a notice of copyright in the form
and position specified by this section appears on the published phonorecord or
phonorecords to which a defendant in a copyright infringement suit had access,
then no weight shall be given to such a defendant’s interposition of a defense
based on innocent infringement in mitigation of actual or statutory damages,
except as provided in the last sentence of section 504(c)(2).
§403 · Notice of copyright: Publications incorporating
United States Government works4
Sections 401(d) and 402(d) shall not apply to a work published in copies or
phonorecords consisting predominantly of one or more works of the United
States Government unless the notice of copyright appearing on the published
copies or phonorecords to which a defendant in the copyright infringement suit
had access includes a statement identifying, either affirmatively or negatively,
those portions of the copies or phonorecords embodying any work or works
protected under this title.
§404 · Notice of copyright: Contributions to collective works5
(a) A separate contribution to a collective work may bear its own notice of
copyright, as provided by sections 401 through 403. However, a single notice applicable
to the collective work as a whole is sufficient to invoke the provisions of
section 401(d) or 402(d), as applicable with respect to the separate contributions
it contains (not including advertisements inserted on behalf of persons other
than the owner of copyright in the collective work), regardless of the ownership
of copyright in the contributions and whether or not they have been previously
published.
(b) With respect to copies and phonorecords publicly distributed by authority
of the copyright owner before the effective date of the Berne Convention 
146 Copyright Law of the United States
§405 Copyright Notice, Deposit, and Registration
Implementation Act of 1988, where the person named in a single notice applicable
to a collective work as a whole is not the owner of copyright in a separate
contribution that does not bear its own notice, the case is governed by the provisions
of section 406(a).
§405 · Notice of copyright: Omission of notice on certain copies
and phonorecords6
(a) Effect of Omission on Copyright.—With respect to copies and phonorecords
publicly distributed by authority of the copyright owner before the
effective date of the Berne Convention Implementation Act of 1988, the omission
of the copyright notice described in sections 401 through 403 from copies
or phonorecords publicly distributed by authority of the copyright owner does
not invalidate the copyright in a work if—
(1) the notice has been omitted from no more than a relatively small number
of copies or phonorecords distributed to the public; or
(2) registration for the work has been made before or is made within five
years after the publication without notice, and a reasonable effort is made to
add notice to all copies or phonorecords that are distributed to the public in
the United States after the omission has been discovered; or
(3) the notice has been omitted in violation of an express requirement
in writing that, as a condition of the copyright owner’s authorization of
the public distribution of copies or phonorecords, they bear the prescribed
notice.
(b) Effect of Omission on Innocent Infringers.—Any person who
innocently infringes a copyright, in reliance upon an authorized copy or phonorecord
from which the copyright notice has been omitted and which was publicly
distributed by authority of the copyright owner before the effective date of the
Berne Convention Implementation Act of 1988, incurs no liability for actual or
statutory damages under section 504 for any infringing acts committed before
receiving actual notice that registration for the work has been made under section
408, if such person proves that he or she was misled by the omission of notice. In
a suit for infringement in such a case the court may allow or disallow recovery
of any of the infringer’s profits attributable to the infringement, and may enjoin
the continuation of the infringing undertaking or may require, as a condition for
permitting the continuation of the infringing undertaking, that the infringer pay
the copyright owner a reasonable license fee in an amount and on terms fixed
by the court.
(c) Removal of Notice.—Protection under this title is not affected by the
removal, destruction, or obliteration of the notice, without the authorization of
the copyright owner, from any publicly distributed copies or phonorecords.
Copyright Law of the United States 147
Copyright Notice, Deposit, and Registration §407
§406 · Notice of copyright: Error in name or date
on certain copies and phonorecords7
(a) Error in Name.—With respect to copies and phonorecords publicly
distributed by authority of the copyright owner before the effective date of the
Berne Convention Implementation Act of 1988, where the person named in the
copyright notice on copies or phonorecords publicly distributed by authority
of the copyright owner is not the owner of copyright, the validity and ownership
of the copyright are not affected. In such a case, however, any person who
innocently begins an undertaking that infringes the copyright has a complete
defense to any action for such infringement if such person proves that he or
she was misled by the notice and began the undertaking in good faith under a
purported transfer or license from the person named therein, unless before the
undertaking was begun—
(1) registration for the work had been made in the name of the owner of
copyright; or
(2) a document executed by the person named in the notice and showing
the ownership of the copyright had been recorded.
The person named in the notice is liable to account to the copyright owner for
all receipts from transfers or licenses purportedly made under the copyright by
the person named in the notice.
(b) Error in Date.—When the year date in the notice on copies or phonorecords
distributed before the effective date of the Berne Convention Implementation
Act of 1988 by authority of the copyright owner is earlier than the
year in which publication first occurred, any period computed from the year of
first publication under section 302 is to be computed from the year in the notice.
Where the year date is more than one year later than the year in which publication
first occurred, the work is considered to have been published without any notice
and is governed by the provisions of section 405.
(c) Omission of Name or Date.—Where copies or phonorecords publicly
distributed before the effective date of the Berne Convention Implementation
Act of 1988 by authority of the copyright owner contain no name or no date
that could reasonably be considered a part of the notice, the work is considered
to have been published without any notice and is governed by the provisions of
section 405 as in effect on the day before the effective date of the Berne Convention
Implementation Act of 1988.
§407 · Deposit of copies or phonorecords for Library of Congress8
(a) Except as provided by subsection (c), and subject to the provisions of subsection
(e), the owner of copyright or of the exclusive right of publication in a 
148 Copyright Law of the United States
§407 Copyright Notice, Deposit, and Registration
work published in the United States shall deposit, within three months after the
date of such publication—
(1) two complete copies of the best edition; or
(2) if the work is a sound recording, two complete phonorecords of the
best edition, together with any printed or other visually perceptible material
published with such phonorecords.
Neither the deposit requirements of this subsection nor the acquisition provisions
of subsection (e) are conditions of copyright protection.
(b) The required copies or phonorecords shall be deposited in the Copyright
Office for the use or disposition of the Library of Congress. The Register of Copyrights
shall, when requested by the depositor and upon payment of the fee prescribed
by section 708, issue a receipt for the deposit.
(c) The Register of Copyrights may by regulation exempt any categories of
material from the deposit requirements of this section, or require deposit of only
one copy or phonorecord with respect to any categories. Such regulations shall
provide either for complete exemption from the deposit requirements of this section,
or for alternative forms of deposit aimed at providing a satisfactory archival
record of a work without imposing practical or financial hardships on the depositor,
where the individual author is the owner of copyright in a pictorial, graphic,
or sculptural work and (i) less than five copies of the work have been published,
or (ii) the work has been published in a limited edition consisting of numbered
copies, the monetary value of which would make the mandatory deposit of two
copies of the best edition of the work burdensome, unfair, or unreasonable.
(d) At any time after publication of a work as provided by subsection (a), the
Register of Copyrights may make written demand for the required deposit on any
of the persons obligated to make the deposit under subsection (a). Unless deposit
is made within three months after the demand is received, the person or persons
on whom the demand was made are liable—
(1) to a fine of not more than $250 for each work; and
(2) to pay into a specially designated fund in the Library of Congress the
total retail price of the copies or phonorecords demanded, or, if no retail price
has been fixed, the reasonable cost to the Library of Congress of acquiring
them; and
(3) to pay a fine of $2,500, in addition to any fine or liability imposed under
clauses (1) and (2), if such person willfully or repeatedly fails or refuses to
comply with such a demand.
(e) With respect to transmission programs that have been fixed and transmitted
to the public in the United States but have not been published, the Register
of Copyrights shall, after consulting with the Librarian of Congress and other
interested organizations and officials, establish regulations governing the acquisition,
through deposit or otherwise, of copies or phonorecords of such programs
for the collections of the Library of Congress.
Copyright Law of the United States 149
Copyright Notice, Deposit, and Registration §408
(1) The Librarian of Congress shall be permitted, under the standards and
conditions set forth in such regulations, to make a fixation of a transmission
program directly from a transmission to the public, and to reproduce one copy
or phonorecord from such fixation for archival purposes.
(2) Such regulations shall also provide standards and procedures by which
the Register of Copyrights may make written demand, upon the owner of the
right of transmission in the United States, for the deposit of a copy or phonorecord
of a specific transmission program. Such deposit may, at the option of
the owner of the right of transmission in the United States, be accomplished
by gift, by loan for purposes of reproduction, or by sale at a price not to exceed
the cost of reproducing and supplying the copy or phonorecord. The
regulations established under this clause shall provide reasonable periods of
not less than three months for compliance with a demand, and shall allow for
extensions of such periods and adjustments in the scope of the demand or the
methods for fulfilling it, as reasonably warranted by the circumstances. Willful
failure or refusal to comply with the conditions prescribed by such regulations
shall subject the owner of the right of transmission in the United States to liability
for an amount, not to exceed the cost of reproducing and supplying the
copy or phonorecord in question, to be paid into a specially designated fund
in the Library of Congress.
(3) Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to require the making
or retention, for purposes of deposit, of any copy or phonorecord of an unpublished
transmission program, the transmission of which occurs before the
receipt of a specific written demand as provided by clause (2).
(4) No activity undertaken in compliance with regulations prescribed under
clauses (1) and (2) of this subsection shall result in liability if intended solely to
assist in the acquisition of copies or phonorecords under this subsection.
§408 · Copyright registration in general9
(a) Registration Permissive.—At any time during the subsistence of the
first term of copyright in any published or unpublished work in which the copyright
was secured before January 1, 1978, and during the subsistence of any copyright
secured on or after that date, the owner of copyright or of any exclusive
right in the work may obtain registration of the copyright claim by delivering
to the Copyright Office the deposit specified by this section, together with the
application and fee specified by sections 409 and 708. Such registration is not a
condition of copyright protection.
(b) Deposit for Copyright Registration.—Except as provided by subsection
(c), the material deposited for registration shall include—
(1) in the case of an unpublished work, one complete copy or phonorecord;
150 Copyright Law of the United States
§408 Copyright Notice, Deposit, and Registration
(2) in the case of a published work, two complete copies or phonorecords
of the best edition;
(3) in the case of a work first published outside the United States, one complete
copy or phonorecord as so published;
(4) in the case of a contribution to a collective work, one complete copy or
phonorecord of the best edition of the collective work.
Copies or phonorecords deposited for the Library of Congress under section
407 may be used to satisfy the deposit provisions of this section, if they
are accompanied by the prescribed application and fee, and by any additional
identifying material that the Register may, by regulation, require. The Register
shall also prescribe regulations establishing requirements under which copies or
phonorecords acquired for the Library of Congress under subsection (e) of section
407, otherwise than by deposit, may be used to satisfy the deposit provisions
of this section.
(c) Administrative Classification and Optional Deposit—
(1) The Register of Copyrights is authorized to specify by regulation the administrative
classes into which works are to be placed for purposes of deposit
and registration, and the nature of the copies or phonorecords to be deposited
in the various classes specified. The regulations may require or permit,
for particular classes, the deposit of identifying material instead of copies or
phonorecords, the deposit of only one copy or phonorecord where two would
normally be required, or a single registration for a group of related works. This
administrative classification of works has no significance with respect to the
subject matter of copyright or the exclusive rights provided by this title.
(2) Without prejudice to the general authority provided under clause (1),
the Register of Copyrights shall establish regulations specifically permitting
a single registration for a group of works by the same individual author, all
first published as contributions to periodicals, including newspapers, within a
twelve-month period, on the basis of a single deposit, application, and registration
fee, under the following conditions—
(A) if the deposit consists of one copy of the entire issue of the periodical,
or of the entire section in the case of a newspaper, in which each contribution
was first published; and
(B) if the application identifies each work separately, including the periodical
containing it and its date of first publication.
(3) As an alternative to separate renewal registrations under subsection (a)
of section 304, a single renewal registration may be made for a group of works
by the same individual author, all first published as contributions to periodicals,
including newspapers, upon the filing of a single application and fee,
under all of the following conditions:
(A) the renewal claimant or claimants, and the basis of claim or claims
under section 304(a), is the same for each of the works; and
Copyright Law of the United States 151
Copyright Notice, Deposit, and Registration §408
(B) the works were all copyrighted upon their first publication, either
through separate copyright notice and registration or by virtue of a general
copyright notice in the periodical issue as a whole; and
(C) the renewal application and fee are received not more than twentyeight
or less than twenty-seven years after the thirty-first day of December
of the calendar year in which all of the works were first published; and
(D) the renewal application identifies each work separately, including the
periodical containing it and its date of first publication.
(d) Corrections and Amplifications.—The Register may also establish,
by regulation, formal procedures for the filing of an application for supplementary
registration, to correct an error in a copyright registration or to amplify the
information given in a registration. Such application shall be accompanied by
the fee provided by section 708, and shall clearly identify the registration to be
corrected or amplified. The information contained in a supplementary registration
augments but does not supersede that contained in the earlier registration.
(e) Published Edition of Previously Registered Work.—Registration
for the first published edition of a work previously registered in unpublished
form may be made even though the work as published is substantially the same
as the unpublished version.
(f) Preregistration of Works Being Prepared for Commercial
Distribution.—
(1) Rulemaking.—Not later than 180 days after the date of enactment of
this subsection, the Register of Copyrights shall issue regulations to establish
procedures for preregistration of a work that is being prepared for commercial
distribution and has not been published.
(2) Class of works.—The regulations established under paragraph (1)
shall permit preregistration for any work that is in a class of works that the
Register determines has had a history of infringement prior to authorized
commercial distribution.
(3) Application for registration.—Not later than 3 months after the
first publication of a work preregistered under this subsection, the applicant
shall submit to the Copyright Office–
(A) an application for registration of the work;
(B) a deposit; and
(C) the applicable fee.
(4) Effect of untimely application.—An action under this chapter for
infringement of a work preregistered under this subsection, in a case in which
the infringement commenced no later than 2 months after the first publication
of the work, shall be dismissed if the items described in paragraph (3) are
not submitted to the Copyright Office in proper form within the earlier of—
(A) 3 months after the first publication of the work; or
(B) 1 month after the copyright owner has learned of the infringement.
152 Copyright Law of the United States
§409 Copyright Notice, Deposit, and Registration
§409 · Application for copyright registration10
The application for copyright registration shall be made on a form prescribed
by the Register of Copyrights and shall include—
(1) the name and address of the copyright claimant;
(2) in the case of a work other than an anonymous or pseudonymous work,
the name and nationality or domicile of the author or authors, and, if one or
more of the authors is dead, the dates of their deaths;
(3) if the work is anonymous or pseudonymous, the nationality or domicile
of the author or authors;
(4) in the case of a work made for hire, a statement to this effect;
(5) if the copyright claimant is not the author, a brief statement of how the
claimant obtained ownership of the copyright;
(6) the title of the work, together with any previous or alternative titles
under which the work can be identified;
(7) the year in which creation of the work was completed;
(8) if the work has been published, the date and nation of its first publication;
(9) in the case of a compilation or derivative work, an identification of
any preexisting work or works that it is based on or incorporates, and a brief,
general statement of the additional material covered by the copyright claim
being registered; and
(10) any other information regarded by the Register of Copyrights as bearing
upon the preparation or identification of the work or the existence, ownership,
or duration of the copyright.
If an application is submitted for the renewed and extended term provided
for in section 304(a)(3)(A) and an original term registration has not been made,
the Register may request information with respect to the existence, ownership, or
duration of the copyright for the original term.
§410 · Registration of claim and issuance of certificate
(a) When, after examination, the Register of Copyrights determines that, in
accordance with the provisions of this title, the material deposited constitutes
copyrightable subject matter and that the other legal and formal requirements
of this title have been met, the Register shall register the claim and issue to the
applicant a certificate of registration under the seal of the Copyright Office. The
certificate shall contain the information given in the application, together with
the number and effective date of the registration.
(b) In any case in which the Register of Copyrights determines that, in accordance
with the provisions of this title, the material deposited does not constitute
copyrightable subject matter or that the claim is invalid for any other reason, the 
Copyright Law of the United States 153
Copyright Notice, Deposit, and Registration §411
Register shall refuse registration and shall notify the applicant in writing of the
reasons for such refusal.
(c) In any judicial proceedings the certificate of a registration made before or
within five years after first publication of the work shall constitute prima facie
evidence of the validity of the copyright and of the facts stated in the certificate.
The evidentiary weight to be accorded the certificate of a registration made thereafter
shall be within the discretion of the court.
(d) The effective date of a copyright registration is the day on which an application,
deposit, and fee, which are later determined by the Register of Copyrights
or by a court of competent jurisdiction to be acceptable for registration, have all
been received in the Copyright Office.
§411 · Registration and civil infringement actions11
(a) Except for an action brought for a violation of the rights of the author under
section 106A(a), and subject to the provisions of subsection (b), no civil action
for infringement of the copyright in any United States work shall be instituted
until preregistration or registration of the copyright claim has been made in accordance
with this title. In any case, however, where the deposit, application, and
fee required for registration have been delivered to the Copyright Office in proper
form and registration has been refused, the applicant is entitled to institute a civil
action for infringement if notice thereof, with a copy of the complaint, is served
on the Register of Copyrights. The Register may, at his or her option, become a
party to the action with respect to the issue of registrability of the copyright claim
by entering an appearance within sixty days after such service, but the Register’s
failure to become a party shall not deprive the court of jurisdiction to determine
that issue.
(b)(1) A certificate of registration satisfies the requirements of this section and
section 412, regardless of whether the certificate contains any inaccurate information,
unless—
(A) the inaccurate information was included on the application for
copyright registration with knowledge that it was inaccurate; and
(B) the inaccuracy of the information, if known, would have caused the
Register of Copyrights to refuse registration.
(2) In any case in which inaccurate information described under paragraph (1)
is alleged, the court shall request the Register of Copyrights to advise the court
whether the inaccurate information, if known, would have caused the Register
of Copyrights to refuse registration.
(3) Nothing in this subsection shall affect any rights, obligations, or requirements
of a person related to information contained in a registration certificate, 
154 Copyright Law of the United States
§412 Copyright Notice, Deposit, and Registration
except for the institution of and remedies in infringement actions under this
section and section 412.
(c) In the case of a work consisting of sounds, images, or both, the first fixation
of which is made simultaneously with its transmission, the copyright owner may,
either before or after such fixation takes place, institute an action for infringement
under section 501, fully subject to the remedies provided by sections 502
through 505 and section 510, if, in accordance with requirements that the Register
of Copyrights shall prescribe by regulation, the copyright owner—
(1) serves notice upon the infringer, not less than 48 hours before such fixation,
identifying the work and the specific time and source of its first transmission,
and declaring an intention to secure copyright in the work; and
(2) makes registration for the work, if required by subsection (a), within
three months after its first transmission.
§412 · Registration as prerequisite to certain remedies
for infringement12
In any action under this title, other than an action brought for a violation of
the rights of the author under section 106A(a), an action for infringement of the
copyright of a work that has been preregistered under section 408(f) before the
commencement of the infringement and that has an effective date of registration
not later than the earlier of 3 months after the first publication of the work or 1
month after the copyright owner has learned of the infringement, or an action
instituted under section 411(c), no award of statutory damages or of attorney’s
fees, as provided by sections 504 and 505, shall be made for—
(1) any infringement of copyright in an unpublished work commenced
before the effective date of its registration; or
(2) any infringement of copyright commenced after first publication of the
work and before the effective date of its registration, unless such registration
is made within three months after the first publication of the work.

158 Copyright Law of the United States
§501 Copyright Infringement and Remedies
§501 · Infringement of copyright3
(a) Anyone who violates any of the exclusive rights of the copyright owner
as provided by sections 106 through 122 or of the author as provided in section
106A(a), or who imports copies or phonorecords into the United States in violation
of section 602, is an infringer of the copyright or right of the author, as the
case may be. For purposes of this chapter (other than section 506), any reference
to copyright shall be deemed to include the rights conferred by section 106A(a).
As used in this subsection, the term “anyone” includes any State, any instrumentality
of a State, and any officer or employee of a State or instrumentality of a
State acting in his or her official capacity. Any State, and any such instrumentality,
officer, or employee, shall be subject to the provisions of this title in the same
manner and to the same extent as any nongovernmental entity.
(b) The legal or beneficial owner of an exclusive right under a copyright is
entitled, subject to the requirements of section 411, to institute an action for any
infringement of that particular right committed while he or she is the owner
of it. The court may require such owner to serve written notice of the action
with a copy of the complaint upon any person shown, by the records of the
Copyright Office or otherwise, to have or claim an interest in the copyright, and
shall require that such notice be served upon any person whose interest is likely
to be affected by a decision in the case. The court may require the joinder, and
shall permit the intervention, of any person having or claiming an interest in
the copyright.
(c) For any secondary transmission by a cable system that embodies a performance
or a display of a work which is actionable as an act of infringement under
subsection (c) of section 111, a television broadcast station holding a copyright
or other license to transmit or perform the same version of that work shall, for
purposes of subsection (b) of this section, be treated as a legal or beneficial owner
if such secondary transmission occurs within the local service area of that television
station.
(d) For any secondary transmission by a cable system that is actionable as an
act of infringement pursuant to section 111(c)(3), the following shall also have
standing to sue: (i) the primary transmitter whose transmission has been altered
by the cable system; and (ii) any broadcast station within whose local service area
the secondary transmission occurs.
(e) With respect to any secondary transmission that is made by a satellite carrier
of a performance or display of a work embodied in a primary transmission
and is actionable as an act of infringement under section 119(a)(5), a network station
holding a copyright or other license to transmit or perform the same version
of that work shall, for purposes of subsection (b) of this section, be treated as a
legal or beneficial owner if such secondary transmission occurs within the local
service area of that station.
Copyright Law of the United States 159
Copyright Infringement and Remedies §503
(f)(1) With respect to any secondary transmission that is made by a satellite
carrier of a performance or display of a work embodied in a primary transmission
and is actionable as an act of infringement under section 122, a television
broadcast station holding a copyright or other license to transmit or perform the
same version of that work shall, for purposes of subsection (b) of this section, be
treated as a legal or beneficial owner if such secondary transmission occurs within
the local market of that station.
(2) A television broadcast station may file a civil action against any satellite
carrier that has refused to carry television broadcast signals, as required under
section 122(a)(2), to enforce that television broadcast station’s rights under
section 338(a) of the Communications Act of 1934.
§502 · Remedies for infringement: Injunctions
(a) Any court having jurisdiction of a civil action arising under this title may,
subject to the provisions of section 1498 of title 28, grant temporary and final
injunctions on such terms as it may deem reasonable to prevent or restrain infringement
of a copyright.
(b) Any such injunction may be served anywhere in the United States on the
person enjoined; it shall be operative throughout the United States and shall be
enforceable, by proceedings in contempt or otherwise, by any United States court
having jurisdiction of that person. The clerk of the court granting the injunction
shall, when requested by any other court in which enforcement of the injunction
is sought, transmit promptly to the other court a certified copy of all the papers
in the case on file in such clerk’s office.
§503 · Remedies for infringement:
Impounding and disposition of infringing articles4
(a)(1) At any time while an action under this title is pending,
the court may order the impounding, on such terms as it may deem
reasonable—
(A) of all copies or phonorecords claimed to have been made or used in
violation of the exclusive right of the copyright owner;
(B) of all plates, molds, matrices, masters, tapes, film negatives, or other
articles by means of which such copies or phonorecords may be reproduced;
and
(C) of records documenting the manufacture, sale, or receipt of things
involved in any such violation, provided that any records seized under this
subparagraph shall be taken into the custody of the court.
160 Copyright Law of the United States
§504 Copyright Infringement and Remedies
(2) For impoundments of records ordered under paragraph (1)(C), the court
shall enter an appropriate protective order with respect to discovery and use
of any records or information that has been impounded. The protective order
shall provide for appropriate procedures to ensure that confidential, private,
proprietary, or privileged information contained in such records is not improperly
disclosed or used.
(3) The relevant provisions of paragraphs (2) through (11) of section 34(d)
of the Trademark Act (15 U.S.C. 1116(d)(2) through (11)) shall extend to any
impoundment of records ordered under paragraph (1)(C) that is based upon
an ex parte application, notwithstanding the provisions of rule 65 of the Federal
Rules of Civil Procedure. Any references in paragraphs (2) through (11)
of section 34(d) of the Trademark Act to section 32 of such Act shall be read
as references to section 501 of this title, and references to use of a counterfeit
mark in connection with the sale, offering for sale, or distribution of goods or
services shall be read as references to infringement of a copyright.
(b) As part of a final judgment or decree, the court may order the destruction
or other reasonable disposition of all copies or phonorecords found to have been
made or used in violation of the copyright owner’s exclusive rights, and of all
plates, molds, matrices, masters, tapes, film negatives, or other articles by means
of which such copies or phonorecords may be reproduced.
§504 · Remedies for infringement: Damages and profits5
(a) In General.—Except as otherwise provided by this title, an infringer of
copyright is liable for either—
(1) the copyright owner’s actual damages and any additional profits of the
infringer, as provided by subsection (b); or
(2) statutory damages, as provided by subsection (c).
(b) Actual Damages and Profits.—The copyright owner is entitled to recover
the actual damages suffered by him or her as a result of the infringement, and
any profits of the infringer that are attributable to the infringement and are not
taken into account in computing the actual damages. In establishing the infringer’s
profits, the copyright owner is required to present proof only of the infringer’s
gross revenue, and the infringer is required to prove his or her deductible expenses
and the elements of profit attributable to factors other than the copyrighted work.
(c) Statutory Damages.—
(1) Except as provided by clause (2) of this subsection, the copyright owner
may elect, at any time before final judgment is rendered, to recover, instead
of actual damages and profits, an award of statutory damages for all infringements
involved in the action, with respect to any one work, for which any one
infringer is liable individually, or for which any two or more infringers are li-
Copyright Law of the United States 161
Copyright Infringement and Remedies §504
able jointly and severally, in a sum of not less than $750 or more than $30,000
as the court considers just. For the purposes of this subsection, all the parts of
a compilation or derivative work constitute one work.
(2) In a case where the copyright owner sustains the burden of proving, and
the court finds, that infringement was committed willfully, the court in its discretion
may increase the award of statutory damages to a sum of not more than
$150,000. In a case where the infringer sustains the burden of proving, and the
court finds, that such infringer was not aware and had no reason to believe that
his or her acts constituted an infringement of copyright, the court in its discretion
may reduce the award of statutory damages to a sum of not less than $200. The
court shall remit statutory damages in any case where an infringer believed and
had reasonable grounds for believing that his or her use of the copyrighted work
was a fair use under section 107, if the infringer was: (i) an employee or agent of
a nonprofit educational institution, library, or archives acting within the scope of
his or her employment who, or such institution, library, or archives itself, which
infringed by reproducing the work in copies or phonorecords; or (ii) a public
broadcasting entity which or a person who, as a regular part of the nonprofit
activities of a public broadcasting entity (as defined in section 118(f)) infringed by
performing a published nondramatic literary work or by reproducing a transmission
program embodying a performance of such a work.
(3) (A) In a case of infringement, it shall be a rebuttable presumption that
the infringement was committed willfully for purposes of determining relief
if the violator, or a person acting in concert with the violator, knowingly provided
or knowingly caused to be provided materially false contact information
to a domain name registrar, domain name registry, or other domain name
registration authority in registering, maintaining, or renewing a domain name
used in connection with the infringement.
(B) Nothing in this paragraph limits what may be considered willful infringement
under this subsection.
(C) For purposes of this paragraph, the term “domain name” has the meaning
given that term in section 45 of the Act entitled “An Act to provide for the
registration and protection of trademarks used in commerce, to carry out the
provisions of certain international conventions, and for other purposes” approved
July 5, 1946 (commonly referred to as the “Trademark Act of 1946”; 15
U.S.C. 1127).
(d) Additional Damages in Certain Cases.—In any case in which the
court finds that a defendant proprietor of an establishment who claims as a defense
that its activities were exempt under section 110(5) did not have reasonable
grounds to believe that its use of a copyrighted work was exempt under such section,
the plaintiff shall be entitled to, in addition to any award of damages under
this section, an additional award of two times the amount of the license fee that 
162 Copyright Law of the United States
§505 Copyright Infringement and Remedies
the proprietor of the establishment concerned should have paid the plaintiff for
such use during the preceding period of up to 3 years.
§505 · Remedies for infringement: Costs and attorney’s fees
In any civil action under this title, the court in its discretion may allow the
recovery of full costs by or against any party other than the United States or an officer
thereof. Except as otherwise provided by this title, the court may also award
a reasonable attorney’s fee to the prevailing party as part of the costs.
§506 · Criminal offenses6
(a) Criminal Infringement.—
(1) In general.—Any person who willfully infringes a copyright shall be
punished as provided under section 2319 of title 18, if the infringement was
committed—

during any 180-day period, of 1 or more copies or phonorecords of 1 or
more copyrighted works, which have a total retail value of more than
$1,000; or
(C) by the distribution of a work being prepared for commercial distribution,
by making it available on a computer network accessible to members
of the public, if such person knew or should have known that the work
was intended for commercial distribution.
(2) Evidence.—For purposes of this subsection, evidence of reproduction
or distribution of a copyrighted work, by itself, shall not be sufficient to
establish willful infringement of a copyright.
(3) Definition.—In this subsection, the term “work being prepared for
commercial distribution” means—
(A) a computer program, a musical work, a motion picture or other
audiovisual work, or a sound recording, if, at the time of unauthorized

distribution; and

provider’s designated agent fails to comply substantially with all the
provisions of subparagraph (A) but substantially complies with clauses

misidentification,
shall be liable for any damages, including costs and attorneys’ fees, incurred by
the alleged infringer, by any copyright owner or copyright owner’s authorized
licensee, or by a service provider, who is injured by such misrepresentation, as
the result of the service provider relying upon such misrepresentation in removing
or disabling access to the material or activity claimed to be infringing, or in
replacing the removed material or ceasing to disable access to it.
(g) Replacement of Removed or Disabled Material and Limitation
on Other Liability.—
(1) No liability for taking down generally.—Subject to paragraph
(2), a service provider shall not be liable to any person for any claim based on
the service provider’s good faith disabling of access to, or removal of, material
or activity claimed to be infringing or based on facts or circumstances from
which infringing activity is apparent, regardless of whether the material or
activity is ultimately determined to be infringing.
(2) Exception.—Paragraph (1) shall not apply with respect to material
residing at the direction of a subscriber of the service provider on a system or
network controlled or operated by or for the service provider that is removed,

from engaging in infringing activity relating to the material on the service
provider’s system or network.
(3) Contents of counter notification.—To be effective under this
subsection, a counter notification must be a written communication provided

responds to the notification.
(6) Rules applicable to subpoena.—Unless otherwise provided by this
section or by applicable rules of the court, the procedure for issuance and
delivery of the subpoena, and the remedies for noncompliance with the subpoena,
shall be governed to the greatest extent practicable by those provisions
of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure governing the issuance, service, and
enforcement of a subpoena duces tecum.
(i) Conditions for Eligibility.—
(1) Accommodation of technology.—The limitations on liability established
by this section shall apply to a service provider only if the service
provider—
(A) has adopted and reasonably implemented, and informs subscribers
and account holders of the service provider’s system or network of, a policy
that provides for the termination in appropriate circumstances of subscribers
and account holders of the service provider’s system or network who
are repeat infringers; and
(B) accommodates and does not interfere with standard technical
measures.
(2) Definition.—As used in this subsection, the term “standard technical
measures” means technical measures that are used by copyright owners to
identify or protect copyrighted works and—
(A) have been developed pursuant to a broad consensus of copyright
owners and service providers in an open, fair, voluntary, multi-industry
standards process;

terms; and
Copyright Law of the United States 173
Copyright Infringement and Remedies §512
(C) do not impose substantial costs on service providers or substantial
burdens on their systems or networks.
(j) Injunctions.—The following rules shall apply in the case of any application
for an injunction under section 502 against a service provider that is not
subject to monetary remedies under this section:
(1) Scope of relief.—(A) With respect to conduct other than that which
qualifies for the limitation on remedies set forth in subsection (a), the court
may grant injunctive relief with respect to a service provider only in one or
more of the following forms:
(i) An order restraining the service provider from providing access to
infringing material or activity residing at a particular online site on the
provider’s system or network.
(ii) An order restraining the service provider from providing access
to a subscriber or account holder of the service provider’s system or
network who is engaging in infringing activity and is identified in the
order, by terminating the accounts of the subscriber or account holder
that are specified in the order.
(iii) Such other injunctive relief as the court may consider necessary
to prevent or restrain infringement of copyrighted material specified
in the order of the court at a particular online location, if such relief is
the least burdensome to the service provider among the forms of relief
comparably effective for that purpose.
(B) If the service provider qualifies for the limitation on remedies described
in subsection (a), the court may only grant injunctive relief in one
or both of the following forms:
(i) An order restraining the service provider from providing access
to a subscriber or account holder of the service provider’s system or
network who is using the provider’s service to engage in infringing activity
and is identified in the order, by terminating the accounts of the
subscriber or account holder that are specified in the order.
(ii) An order restraining the service provider from providing access,
by taking reasonable steps specified in the order to block access, to a
specific, identified, online location outside the United States.
(2) Considerations.—The court, in considering the relevant criteria for
injunctive relief under applicable law, shall consider—
(A) whether such an injunction, either alone or in combination with
other such injunctions issued against the same service provider under this
subsection, would significantly burden either the provider or the operation
of the provider’s system or network;
(B) the magnitude of the harm likely to be suffered by the copyright
owner in the digital network environment if steps are not taken to prevent
or restrain the infringement;
174 Copyright Law of the United States
§512 Copyright Infringement and Remedies
(C) whether implementation of such an injunction would be technically
feasible and effective, and would not interfere with access to noninfringing
material at other online locations; and
(D) whether other less burdensome and comparably effective means of
preventing or restraining access to the infringing material are available.
(3) Notice and ex parte orders.—Injunctive relief under this subsection
shall be available only after notice to the service provider and an opportunity
for the service provider to appear are provided, except for orders
ensuring the preservation of evidence or other orders having no material
adverse effect on the operation of the service provider’s communications
network.
(k) Definitions.—
(1) Service provider.—(A) As used in subsection (a), the term “service
provider” means an entity offering the transmission, routing, or providing
of connections for digital online communications, between or among points
specified by a user, of material of the user’s choosing, without modification to
the content of the material as sent or received.
(B) As used in this section, other than subsection (a), the term “service
provider” means a provider of online services or network access, or the
operator of facilities therefor, and includes an entity described in subparagraph
(A).
(2) Monetary relief.—As used in this section, the term “monetary relief”
means damages, costs, attorneys’ fees, and any other form of monetary
payment.
(l) Other Defenses Not Affected.—The failure of a service provider’s
conduct to qualify for limitation of liability under this section shall not bear
adversely upon the consideration of a defense by the service provider that
the service provider’s conduct is not infringing under this title or any other
defense.
(m) Protection of Privacy.—Nothing in this section shall be construed
to condition the applicability of subsections (a) through (d) on—
(1) a service provider monitoring its service or affirmatively seeking facts
indicating infringing activity, except to the extent consistent with a standard
technical measure complying with the provisions of subsection (i); or
(2) a service provider gaining access to, removing, or disabling access to
material in cases in which such conduct is prohibited by law.
(n) Construction.—Subsections (a), (b), (c), and (d) describe separate and
distinct functions for purposes of applying this section. Whether a service provider
qualifies for the limitation on liability in any one of those subsections shall
be based solely on the criteria in that subsection, and shall not affect a determination
of whether that service provider qualifies for the limitations on liability
under any other such subsection.

Copyright Infringement and Remedies §513
§513 · Determination of reasonable license fees
for individual proprietors12
In the case of any performing rights society subject to a consent decree which
provides for the determination of reasonable license rates or fees to be charged
by the performing rights society, notwithstanding the provisions of that consent
decree, an individual proprietor who owns or operates fewer than 7 nonpublicly
traded establishments in which nondramatic musical works are performed publicly
and who claims that any license agreement offered by that performing rights
society is unreasonable in its license rate or fee as to that individual proprietor,
shall be entitled to determination of a reasonable license rate or fee as follows:
(1) The individual proprietor may commence such proceeding for determination
of a reasonable license rate or fee by filing an application in the applicable
district court under paragraph (2) that a rate disagreement exists and
by serving a copy of the application on the performing rights society. Such
proceeding shall commence in the applicable district court within 90 days after
the service of such copy, except that such 90-day requirement shall be subject
to the administrative requirements of the court.
(2) The proceeding under paragraph (1) shall be held, at the individual proprietor’s
election, in the judicial district of the district court with jurisdiction
over the applicable consent decree or in that place of holding court of a district
court that is the seat of the Federal circuit (other than the Court of Appeals for
the Federal Circuit) in which the proprietor’s establishment is located.
(3) Such proceeding shall be held before the judge of the court with jurisdiction
over the consent decree governing the performing rights society. At the
discretion of the court, the proceeding shall be held before a special master or
magistrate judge appointed by such judge. Should that consent decree provide
for the appointment of an advisor or advisors to the court for any purpose, any
such advisor shall be the special master so named by the court.
(4) In any such proceeding, the industry rate shall be presumed to have
been reasonable at the time it was agreed to or determined by the court. Such
presumption shall in no way affect a determination of whether the rate is being
correctly applied to the individual proprietor.
(5) Pending the completion of such proceeding, the individual proprietor
shall have the right to perform publicly the copyrighted musical compositions
in the repertoire of the performing rights society by paying an interim license
rate or fee into an interest bearing escrow account with the clerk of the court,
subject to retroactive adjustment when a final rate or fee has been determined,
in an amount equal to the industry rate, or, in the absence of an industry rate,
the amount of the most recent license rate or fee agreed to by the parties.
(6) Any decision rendered in such proceeding by a special master or magistrate
judge named under paragraph (3) shall be reviewed by the judge of 
176 Copyright Law of the United States
Notes Copyright Infringement and Remedies
the court with jurisdiction over the consent decree governing the performing
rights society. Such proceeding, including such review, shall be concluded
within 6 months after its commencement.
(7) Any such final determination shall be binding only as to the individual
proprietor commencing the proceeding, and shall not be applicable to any
other proprietor or any other performing rights society, and the performing
rights society shall be relieved of any obligation of nondiscrimination among
similarly situated music users that may be imposed by the consent decree
governing its operations.
(8) An individual proprietor may not bring more than one proceeding provided
for in this section for the determination of a reasonable license rate or fee
under any license agreement with respect to any one performing rights society.
(9) For purposes of this section, the term “industry rate” means the license
fee a performing rights society has agreed to with, or which has been determined
by the court for, a significant segment of the music user industry to
which the individual proprietor belongs.

§601 Importation and Exportation1
§601 · [Repealed]4
§602 · Infringing importation or exportation of copies
or phonorecords5
(a) Infringing Importation or Exportation.—
(1)Importation.—Importation into the United States, without the authority
of the owner of copyright under this title, of copies or phonorecords
of a work that have been acquired outside the United States is an infringement
of the exclusive right to distribute copies or phonorecords under section 106,
actionable under section 501.
(2) Importation or exportation of infringing items.—Importation
into the United States or exportation from the United States, without
the authority of the owner of copyright under this title, of copies or phonorecords,
the making of which either constituted an infringement of copyright,
or which would have constituted an infringement of copyright if this title had
been applicable, is an infringement of the exclusive right to distribute copies
or phonorecords under section 106, actionable under sections 501 and 506.
(3) Exceptions.—This subsection does not apply to—
(A) importation or exportation of copies or phonorecords under the
authority or for the use of the Government of the United States or of any
State or political subdivision of a State, but not including copies or phonorecords
for use in schools, or copies of any audiovisual work imported for
purposes other than archival use;
(B) importation or exportation, for the private use of the importer or
exporter and not for distribution, by any person with respect to no more
than one copy or phonorecord of any one work at any one time, or by
any person arriving from outside the United States or departing from the
United States with respect to copies or phonorecords forming part of such
person’s personal baggage; or
(C) importation by or for an organization operated for scholarly, educational,
or religious purposes and not for private gain, with respect to no
more than one copy of an audiovisual work solely for its archival purposes,
and no more than five copies or phonorecords of any other work for its
library lending or archival purposes, unless the importation of such copies
or phonorecords is part of an activity consisting of systematic reproduction
or distribution, engaged in by such organization in violation of the provisions
of section 108(g)(2).
(b) Import Prohibition.—In a case where the making of the copies or phonorecords
would have constituted an infringement of copyright if this title had 
Copyright Law of the United States 181
Importation and Exportation1
been applicable, their importation is prohibited. In a case where the copies or
phonorecords were lawfully made, the United States Customs and Border Protection
Service has no authority to prevent their importation. In either case, the
Secretary of the Treasury is authorized to prescribe, by regulation, a procedure
under which any person claiming an interest in the copyright in a particular work
may, upon payment of a specified fee, be entitled to notification by the United
States Customs and Border Protection Service of the importation of articles that
appear to be copies or phonorecords of the work.
§603 · Importation prohibitions:
Enforcement and disposition of excluded articles6
(a) The Secretary of the Treasury and the United States Postal Service shall
separately or jointly make regulations for the enforcement of the provisions of
this title prohibiting importation.
(b) These regulations may require, as a condition for the exclusion of articles
under section 602—
(1) that the person seeking exclusion obtain a court order enjoining importation
of the articles; or
(2) that the person seeking exclusion furnish proof, of a specified nature and
in accordance with prescribed procedures, that the copyright in which such
person claims an interest is valid and that the importation would violate the
prohibition in section 602; the person seeking exclusion may also be required
to post a surety bond for any injury that may result if the detention or exclusion
of the articles proves to be unjustified.
(c) Articles imported in violation of the importation prohibitions of this title
are subject to seizure and forfeiture in the same manner as property imported
in violation of the customs revenue laws. Forfeited articles shall be destroyed as
directed by the Secretary of the Treasury or the court, as the case may be.

for any related services;
(10) on filing a statement of account based on secondary transmissions of
primary transmissions pursuant to section 119 or 122; and
(11) on filing a statement of account based on secondary transmissions of
primary transmissions pursuant to section 111.
The Register is authorized to fix fees for other services, including the cost of
preparing copies of Copyright Office records, whether or not such copies are
certified, based on the cost of providing the service. Fees established under paragraphs
(10) and (11) shall be reasonable and may not exceed one-half of the cost
necessary to cover reasonable expenses incurred by the Copyright Office for the
collection and administration of the statements of account and any royalty fees
deposited with such statements.
(b) Adjustment of Fees.—The Register of Copyrights may, by regulation,
adjust the fees for the services specified in paragraphs (1) through (9) of subsection
(a) in the following manner:8
(1) The Register shall conduct a study of the costs incurred by the Copyright
Office for the registration of claims, the recordation of documents, and
the provision of services. The study shall also consider the timing of any adjustment
in fees and the authority to use such fees consistent with the budget.
(2) The Register may, on the basis of the study under paragraph (1), and subject
to paragraph (5), adjust fees to not more than that necessary to cover the
reasonable costs incurred by the Copyright Office for the services described
in paragraph (1), plus a reasonable inflation adjustment to account for any
estimated increase in costs.
(3) Any fee established under paragraph (2) shall be rounded off to the nearest
dollar, or for a fee less than $12, rounded off to the nearest 50 cents.
(4) Fees established under this subsection shall be fair and equitable and
give due consideration to the objectives of the copyright system.
(5) If the Register determines under paragraph (2) that fees should be adjusted,
the Register shall prepare a proposed fee schedule and submit the schedule
with the accompanying economic analysis to the Congress. The fees proposed
by the Register may be instituted after the end of 120 days after the schedule is
submitted to the Congress unless, within that 120-day period, a law is enacted
stating in substance that the Congress does not approve the schedule.
(c) The fees prescribed by or under this section are applicable to the United
States Government and any of its agencies, employees, or officers, but the Register
of Copyrights has discretion to waive the requirement of this subsection in occasional
or isolated cases involving relatively small amounts.
(d) (1) Except as provided in paragraph (2), all fees received under this section
shall be deposited by the Register of Copyrights in the Treasury of the United 
Copyright Law of the United States 189
Copyright Office
States and shall be credited to the appropriations for necessary expenses of the
Copyright Office. Such fees that are collected shall remain available until expended.
The Register may, in accordance with regulations that he or she shall
prescribe, refund any sum paid by mistake or in excess of the fee required by
this section.
(2) In the case of fees deposited against future services, the Register of
Copyrights shall request the Secretary of the Treasury to invest in interestbearing
securities in the United States Treasury any portion of the fees that, as
determined by the Register, is not required to meet current deposit account
demands. Funds from such portion of fees shall be invested in securities that
permit funds to be available to the Copyright Office at all times if they are
determined to be necessary to meet current deposit account demands. Such
investments shall be in public debt securities with maturities suitable to the
needs of the Copyright Office, as determined by the Register of Copyrights,
and bearing interest at rates determined by the Secretary of the Treasury,
taking into consideration current market yields on outstanding marketable
obligations of the United States of comparable maturities.
(3) The income on such investments shall be deposited in the Treasury of
the United States and shall be credited to the appropriations for necessary
expenses of the Copyright Office.
§709 · Delay in delivery caused by disruption of postal
or other services
In any case in which the Register of Copyrights determines, on the basis of
such evidence as the Register may by regulation require, that a deposit, application,
fee, or any other material to be delivered to the Copyright Office by a particular
date, would have been received in the Copyright Office in due time except
for a general disruption or suspension of postal or other transportation or communications
services, the actual receipt of such material in the Copyright Office
within one month after the date on which the Register determines that the disruption
or suspension of such services has terminated, shall be considered timely.

§801 Proceedings by Copyright Royalty Judges
§801 · Copyright Royalty Judges; appointment and functions2
(a) Appointment.—The Librarian of Congress shall appoint 3 full-time
Copyright Royalty Judges, and shall appoint 1 of the 3 as the Chief Copyright
Royalty Judge. The Librarian shall make appointments to such positions after
consultation with the Register of Copyrights.
(b) Functions.—Subject to the provisions of this chapter, the functions of
the Copyright Royalty Judges shall be as follows:
(1) To make determinations and adjustments of reasonable terms and rates
of royalty payments as provided in sections 112(e), 114, 115, 116, 118, 119, and
1004. The rates applicable under sections 114(f)(1)(B), 115, and 116 shall be calculated
to achieve the following objectives:
(A) To maximize the availability of creative works to the public.
(B) To afford the copyright owner a fair return for his or her creative work
and the copyright user a fair income under existing economic conditions.
(C) To reflect the relative roles of the copyright owner and the copyright
user in the product made available to the public with respect to relative
creative contribution, technological contribution, capital investment, cost,
risk, and contribution to the opening of new markets for creative expression
and media for their communication.
(D) To minimize any disruptive impact on the structure of the industries
involved and on generally prevailing industry practices.
(2) To make determinations concerning the adjustment of the copyright
royalty rates under section 111 solely in accordance with the following
provisions:
(A) The rates established by section 111(d)(1)(B) may be adjusted to
reflect—
(i) national monetary inflation or deflation; or
(ii) changes in the average rates charged cable subscribers for the basic
service of providing secondary transmissions to maintain the real constant
dollar level of the royalty fee per subscriber which existed as of the
date of October 19, 1976,
except that—
(I) if the average rates charged cable system subscribers for the basic
service of providing secondary transmissions are changed so that
the average rates exceed national monetary inflation, no change in
the rates established by section 111(d)(1)(B) shall be permitted; and
(II) no increase in the royalty fee shall be permitted based on any reduction
in the average number of distant signal equivalents per subscriber.
The Copyright Royalty Judges may consider all factors relating to the
maintenance of such level of payments, including, as an extenuating factor,
whether the industry has been restrained by subscriber rate regulating 
Copyright Law of the United States 195
Proceedings by Copyright Royalty Judges §801
authorities from increasing the rates for the basic service of providing secondary
transmissions.
(B) In the event that the rules and regulations of the Federal Communications
Commission are amended at any time after April 15, 1976, to permit
the carriage by cable systems of additional television broadcast signals beyond
the local service area of the primary transmitters of such signals, the
royalty rates established by section 111(d)(1)(B) may be adjusted to ensure
that the rates for the additional distant signal equivalents resulting from
such carriage are reasonable in the light of the changes effected by the
amendment to such rules and regulations. In determining the reasonableness
of rates proposed following an amendment of Federal Communications
Commission rules and regulations, the Copyright Royalty Judges shall
consider, among other factors, the economic impact on copyright owners
and users; except that no adjustment in royalty rates shall be made under
this subparagraph with respect to any distant signal equivalent or fraction
thereof represented by—
(i) carriage of any signal permitted under the rules and regulations
of the Federal Communications Commission in effect on April 15, 1976,
or the carriage of a signal of the same type (that is, independent, network,
or noncommercial educational) substituted for such permitted
signal; or
(ii) a television broadcast signal first carried after April 15, 1976, pursuant
to an individual waiver of the rules and regulations of the Federal
Communications Commission, as such rules and regulations were in
effect on April 15, 1976.
(C) In the event of any change in the rules and regulations of the Federal
Communications Commission with respect to syndicated and sports
program exclusivity after April 15, 1976, the rates established by section
111(d)(1)(B) may be adjusted to assure that such rates are reasonable in
light of the changes to such rules and regulations, but any such adjustment
shall apply only to the affected television broadcast signals carried on those
systems affected by the change.
(D) The gross receipts limitations established by section 111(d)(1) (C) and
(D) shall be adjusted to reflect national monetary inflation or deflation or
changes in the average rates charged cable system subscribers for the basic
service of providing secondary transmissions to maintain the real constant
dollar value of the exemption provided by such section, and the royalty rate
specified therein shall not be subject to adjustment.
(3)(A) To authorize the distribution, under sections 111, 119, and 1007, of
those royalty fees collected under sections 111, 119, and 1005, as the case may be,
to the extent that the Copyright Royalty Judges have found that the distribution
of such fees is not subject to controversy.
196 Copyright Law of the United States
§801 Proceedings by Copyright Royalty Judges
(B) In cases where the Copyright Royalty Judges determine that controversy
exists, the Copyright Royalty Judges shall determine the distribution
of such fees, including partial distributions, in accordance with section 111,
119, or 1007, as the case may be.
(C) Notwithstanding section 804(b)(8), the Copyright Royalty Judges, at any
time after the filing of claims under section 111, 119, or 1007, may, upon motion
of one or more of the claimants and after publication in the Federal Register of
a request for responses to the motion from interested claimants, make a partial
distribution of such fees, if, based upon all responses received during the 30-
day period beginning on the date of such publication, the Copyright Royalty
Judges conclude that no claimant entitled to receive such fees has stated a
reasonable objection to the partial distribution, and all such claimants—
(i) agree to the partial distribution;
(ii) sign an agreement obligating them to return any excess amounts
to the extent necessary to comply with the final determination on the
distribution of the fees made under subparagraph (B);
(iii) file the agreement with the Copyright Royalty Judges; and
(iv) agree that such funds are available for distribution.
(D) The Copyright Royalty Judges and any other officer or employee
acting in good faith in distributing funds under subparagraph (C) shall not
be held liable for the payment of any excess fees under subparagraph (C).
The Copyright Royalty Judges shall, at the time the final determination is
made, calculate any such excess amounts.
(4) To accept or reject royalty claims filed under sections 111, 119, and 1007,
on the basis of timeliness or the failure to establish the basis for a claim.
(5) To accept or reject rate adjustment petitions as provided in section 804
and petitions to participate as provided in section 803(b) (1) and (2).
(6) To determine the status of a digital audio recording device or a digital audio
interface device under sections 1002 and 1003, as provided in section 1010.
(7)(A) To adopt as a basis for statutory terms and rates or as a basis for
the distribution of statutory royalty payments, an agreement concerning such
matters reached among some or all of the participants in a proceeding at any
time during the proceeding, except that—
(i) the Copyright Royalty Judges shall provide to those that would be
bound by the terms, rates, or other determination set by any agreement in
a proceeding to determine royalty rates an opportunity to comment on
the agreement and shall provide to participants in the proceeding under
section 803(b)(2) that would be bound by the terms, rates, or other determination
set by the agreement an opportunity to comment on the agreement
and object to its adoption as a basis for statutory terms and rates; and
(ii) the Copyright Royalty Judges may decline to adopt the agreement
as a basis for statutory terms and rates for participants that are not parties 
Copyright Law of the United States 197
Proceedings by Copyright Royalty Judges §802
to the agreement, if any participant described in clause (i) objects to the
agreement and the Copyright Royalty Judges conclude, based on the
record before them if one exists, that the agreement does not provide a
reasonable basis for setting statutory terms or rates.
(B) License agreements voluntarily negotiated pursuant to section 112(e)(5),
114(f)(3), 115(c)(3)(E)(i), 116(c), or 118(b)(2) that do not result in statutory terms
and rates shall not be subject to clauses (i) and (ii) of subparagraph (A).
(C) Interested parties may negotiate and agree to, and the Copyright
Royalty Judges may adopt, an agreement that specifies as terms notice and
recordkeeping requirements that apply in lieu of those that would otherwise
apply under regulations.
(8) To perform other duties, as assigned by the Register of Copyrights within
the Library of Congress, except as provided in section 802(g), at times when
Copyright Royalty Judges are not engaged in performing the other duties set
forth in this section.
(c) Rulings.—The Copyright Royalty Judges may make any necessary procedural
or evidentiary rulings in any proceeding under this chapter and may, before
commencing a proceeding under this chapter, make any such rulings that would
apply to the proceedings conducted by the Copyright Royalty Judges.

the Copyright Royalty Judges with the necessary administrative services related
to proceedings under this chapter.
(e) Location in Library of Congress.—The offices of the Copyright Royalty

of the Copyright Royalty and Distribution Reform Act of 2004, in any case in
which time limits are prescribed under this title for performance of an action
with or by the Copyright Royalty Judges, and in which the last day of the prescribed
period falls on a Saturday, Sunday, holiday, or other nonbusiness day
within the District of Columbia or the Federal Government, the action may be
taken on the next succeeding business day, and is effective as of the date when
the period expired.

in making determinations concerning adjustments and determinations of
copyright royalty rates and terms, the distribution of copyright royalties,
the acceptance or rejection of royalty claims, rate adjustment petitions, and
petitions to participate, and in issuing other rulings under this title, except
that the Copyright Royalty Judges may consult with the Register of Copyrights
on any matter other than a question of fact.

Copyright Royalty Judges, any participant in a proceeding may, request

title and arise in the course of the proceeding. Any request for a written
interpretation shall be in writing and on the record, and reasonable provision
shall be made to permit participants in the proceeding to comment
on the material questions of substantive law in a manner that minimizes
duplication and delay. Except as provided in subparagraph (B), the
Register of Copyrights shall deliver to the Copyright Royalty Judges a
written response within 14 days after the receipt of all briefs and comments
from the participants. The Copyright Royalty Judges shall apply
the legal interpretation embodied in the response of the Register of
Copyrights if it is timely delivered, and the response shall be included in
the record that accompanies the final determination. The authority
under this clause shall not be construed to authorize the Register of
Copyrights to provide an interpretation of questions of procedure before
the Copyright Royalty Judges, the ultimate adjustments and determinations
of copyright royalty rates and terms, the ultimate distribution of
copyright royalties, or the acceptance or rejection of royalty claims, rate
adjustment petitions, or petitions to participate in a proceeding.
(B) Novel questions.—(i) In any case in which a novel material question
of substantive law concerning an interpretation of those provisions of
this title that are the subject of the proceeding is presented, the Copyright 
200 Copyright Law of the United States
§802 Proceedings by Copyright Royalty Judges
Royalty Judges shall request a decision of the Register of Copyrights, in
writing, to resolve such novel question. Reasonable provision shall be made
for comment on such request by the participants in the proceeding, in such
a way as to minimize duplication and delay. The Register of Copyrights
shall transmit his or her decision to the Copyright Royalty Judges within 30
days after the Register of Copyrights receives all of the briefs or comments
of the participants. Such decision shall be in writing and included by the
Copyright Royalty Judges in the record that accompanies their final determination.
If such a decision is timely delivered to the Copyright Royalty
Judges, the Copyright Royalty Judges shall apply the legal determinations
embodied in the decision of the Register of Copyrights in resolving material
questions of substantive law.
(ii) In clause (i), a “novel question of law” is a question of law that
has not been determined in prior decisions, determinations, and rulings
described in section 803(a).
(C) Consultation.—Notwithstanding the provisions of subparagraph
(A), the Copyright Royalty Judges shall consult with the Register of Copyrights
with respect to any determination or ruling that would require that
any act be performed by the Copyright Office, and any such determination
or ruling shall not be binding upon the Register of Copyrights.
(D) Review of legal conclusions by the register of copyrights.—The
Register of Copyrights may review for legal error the
resolution by the Copyright Royalty Judges of a material question of substantive
law under this title that underlies or is contained in a final determination
of the Copyright Royalty Judges. If the Register of Copyrights
concludes, after taking into consideration the views of the participants
in the proceeding, that any resolution reached by the Copyright Royalty
Judges was in material error, the Register of Copyrights shall issue a written
decision correcting such legal error, which shall be made part of the record
of the proceeding. The Register of Copyrights shall issue such written decision
not later than 60 days after the date on which the final determination
by the Copyright Royalty Judges is issued. Additionally, the Register of
Copyrights shall cause to be published in the Federal Register such written
decision, together with a specific identification of the legal conclusion
of the Copyright Royalty Judges that is determined to be erroneous. As to
conclusions of substantive law involving an interpretation of the statutory
provisions of this title, the decision of the Register of Copyrights shall be
binding as precedent upon the Copyright Royalty Judges in subsequent
proceedings under this chapter. When a decision has been rendered pursuant
to this subparagraph, the Register of Copyrights may, on the basis of
and in accordance with such decision, intervene as of right in any appeal of
a final determination of the Copyright Royalty Judges pursuant to section 
Copyright Law of the United States 201
Proceedings by Copyright Royalty Judges §802
803(d) in the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia
Circuit. If, prior to intervening in such an appeal, the Register of Copyrights
gives notification to, and undertakes to consult with, the Attorney
General with respect to such intervention, and the Attorney General fails,
within a reasonable period after receiving such notification, to intervene in
such appeal, the Register of Copyrights may intervene in such appeal in his
or her own name by any attorney designated by the Register of Copyrights
for such purpose. Intervention by the Register of Copyrights in his or her
own name shall not preclude the Attorney General from intervening on
behalf of the United States in such an appeal as may be otherwise provided
or required by law.
(E) Effect on judicial review.—Nothing in this section shall be interpreted
to alter the standard applied by a court in reviewing legal determinations
involving an interpretation or construction of the provisions of this
title or to affect the extent to which any construction or interpretation of
the provisions of this title shall be accorded deference by a reviewing court.
(2) Performance appraisals.—
(A) In general.—Notwithstanding any other provision of law or any
regulation of the Library of Congress, and subject to subparagraph (B), the
Copyright Royalty Judges shall not receive performance appraisals.
(B) Relating to sanction or removal.—To the extent that the Librarian
of Congress adopts regulations under subsection (h) relating to
the sanction or removal of a Copyright Royalty Judge and such regulations
require documentation to establish the cause of such sanction or removal,
the Copyright Royalty Judge may receive an appraisal related specifically to
the cause of the sanction or removal.
(g) Inconsistent Duties Barred.—No Copyright Royalty Judge may undertake
duties that conflict with his or her duties and responsibilities as a Copyright
Royalty Judge.
(h) Standards of Conduct.—The Librarian of Congress shall adopt regulations
regarding the standards of conduct, including financial conflict of interest
and restrictions against ex parte communications, which shall govern the Copyright
Royalty Judges and the proceedings under this chapter.
(i) Removal or Sanction.4—The Librarian of Congress may sanction or
remove a Copyright Royalty Judge for violation of the standards of conduct adopted
under subsection (h), misconduct, neglect of duty, or any disqualifying
physical or mental disability. Any sanction or removal may be made only after
notice and opportunity for a hearing, but the Librarian of Congress may suspend
the Copyright Royalty Judge during the pendency of such hearing. The Librarian
shall appoint an interim Copyright Royalty Judge during the period of any
such suspension.

by any opposing participant, and 1 additional response by each such party.
(B) Bad faith inflation of claim.—If the Copyright Royalty Judges
determine that a participant asserts in bad faith an amount in controversy
in excess of $10,000 for the purpose of avoiding a determination under
the procedure set forth in subparagraph (A), the Copyright Royalty Judges
shall impose a fine on that participant in an amount not to exceed the difference
between the actual amount distributed and the amount asserted
by the participant.
(5) Paper proceedings.—The Copyright Royalty Judges in proceedings
under this chapter may decide, sua sponte or upon motion of a participant,
to determine issues on the basis of the filing of the written direct statement by
the participant, the response by any opposing participant, and one additional
response by each such participant. Prior to making such decision to proceed
on such a paper record only, the Copyright Royalty Judges shall offer to all
parties to the proceeding the opportunity to comment on the decision. The
procedure under this paragraph—
Copyright Law of the United States 205
Proceedings by Copyright Royalty Judges §803

Royalty Judges consider appropriate.
(6) Regulations.—
(A) In general.—The Copyright Royalty Judges may issue regulations

Congress and are subject to judicial review pursuant to chapter 7 of title 5,
except as set forth in subsection (d). Not later than 120 days after Copyright

first appointed after the enactment of the Copyright Royalty and Distribution
Reform Act of 2004, such judges shall issue regulations to govern
proceedings under this chapter.
(B) Interim regulations.—Until regulations are adopted under subparagraph

are not inconsistent with this chapter, except that functions carried
out under such regulations by the Librarian of Congress, the Register of
Copyrights, or copyright arbitration royalty panels that, as of such date of
enactment, are to be carried out by the Copyright Royalty Judges under this
chapter, shall be carried out by the Copyright Royalty Judges under such
regulations.

(ii)(I) Following the submission to the Copyright Royalty Judges of
written direct statements and written rebuttal statements by the participants
in a proceeding under paragraph (2), the Copyright Royalty
Judges, after taking into consideration the views of the participants in 
206 Copyright Law of the United States
§803 Proceedings by Copyright Royalty Judges
the proceeding, shall determine a schedule for conducting and completing
discovery.
(II) In this chapter, the term “written direct statements” means witness
statements, testimony, and exhibits to be presented in the proceedings,
and such other information that is necessary to establish terms
and rates, or the distribution of royalty payments, as the case may be,
as set forth in regulations issued by the Copyright Royalty Judges.
(iii) Hearsay may be admitted in proceedings under this chapter to
the extent deemed appropriate by the Copyright Royalty Judges.
(iv) Discovery in connection with written direct statements shall be
permitted for a period of 60 days, except for discovery ordered by the
Copyright Royalty Judges in connection with the resolution of motions,
orders, and disputes pending at the end of such period. The Copyright
Royalty Judges may order a discovery schedule in connection with written
rebuttal statements.
(v) Any participant under paragraph (2) in a proceeding under this
chapter to determine royalty rates may request of an opposing participant
nonprivileged documents directly related to the written direct
statement or written rebuttal statement of that participant. Any
objection to such a request shall be resolved by a motion or request
to compel production made to the Copyright Royalty Judges in accordance
with regulations adopted by the Copyright Royalty Judges.
Each motion or request to compel discovery shall be determined by
the Copyright Royalty Judges, or by a Copyright Royalty Judge when
permitted under subsection (a)(2). Upon such motion, the Copyright
Royalty Judges may order discovery pursuant to regulations established
under this paragraph.
(vi)(I) Any participant under paragraph (2) in a proceeding under
this chapter to determine royalty rates may, by means of written
motion or on the record, request of an opposing participant or witness
other relevant information and materials if, absent the discovery
sought, the Copyright Royalty Judges’ resolution of the proceeding
would be substantially impaired. In determining whether discovery
will be granted under this clause, the Copyright Royalty Judges may
consider—
(aa) whether the burden or expense of producing the requested
information or materials outweighs the likely benefit, taking into
account the needs and resources of the participants, the importance
of the issues at stake, and the probative value of the requested
information or materials in resolving such issues;
(bb) whether the requested information or materials would be
unreasonably cumulative or duplicative, or are obtainable from 
Copyright Law of the United States 207
Proceedings by Copyright Royalty Judges §803
another source that is more convenient, less burdensome, or less
expensive; and
(cc) whether the participant seeking discovery has had ample
opportunity by discovery in the proceeding or by other means to
obtain the information sought.
(II) This clause shall not apply to any proceeding scheduled to
commence after December 31, 2010.
(vii) In a proceeding under this chapter to determine royalty rates, the
participants entitled to receive royalties shall collectively be permitted to
take no more than 10 depositions and secure responses to no more than
25 interrogatories, and the participants obligated to pay royalties shall
collectively be permitted to take no more than 10 depositions and secure
responses to no more than 25 interrogatories. The Copyright Royalty
Judges shall resolve any disputes among similarly aligned participants to
allocate the number of depositions or interrogatories permitted under
this clause.
(viii) The rules and practices in effect on the day before the effective
date of the Copyright Royalty and Distribution Reform Act of 2004,
relating to discovery in proceedings under this chapter to determine the
distribution of royalty fees, shall continue to apply to such proceedings
on and after such effective date.
(ix) In proceedings to determine royalty rates, the Copyright Royalty
Judges may issue a subpoena commanding a participant or witness
to appear and give testimony, or to produce and permit inspection of
documents or tangible things, if the Copyright Royalty Judges’ resolution
of the proceeding would be substantially impaired by the absence
of such testimony or production of documents or tangible things. Such
subpoena shall specify with reasonable particularity the materials to be
produced or the scope and nature of the required testimony. Nothing
in this clause shall preclude the Copyright Royalty Judges from requesting
the production by a nonparticipant of information or materials
relevant to the resolution by the Copyright Royalty Judges of a material
issue of fact.
(x) The Copyright Royalty Judges shall order a settlement conference
among the participants in the proceeding to facilitate the presentation
of offers of settlement among the participants. The settlement conference
shall be held during a 21-day period following the 60-day discovery
period specified in clause (iv) and shall take place outside the presence
of the Copyright Royalty Judges.
(xi) No evidence, including exhibits, may be submitted in the written
direct statement or written rebuttal statement of a participant without
a sponsoring witness, except where the Copyright Royalty Judges have 
208 Copyright Law of the United States
§803 Proceedings by Copyright Royalty Judges
taken official notice, or in the case of incorporation by reference of past
records, or for good cause shown.
(c) Determination of Copyright Royalty Judges.—
(1) Timing.—The Copyright Royalty Judges shall issue their determination
in a proceeding not later than 11 months after the conclusion of the 21-day
settlement conference period under subsection (b)(6)(C)(x), but, in the case
of a proceeding to determine successors to rates or terms that expire on a
specified date, in no event later than 15 days before the expiration of the then
current statutory rates and terms.
(2) Rehearings.—
(A) In general.—The Copyright Royalty Judges may, in exceptional
cases, upon motion of a participant in a proceeding under subsection (b)(2),
order a rehearing, after the determination in the proceeding is issued under
paragraph (1), on such matters as the Copyright Royalty Judges determine
to be appropriate.
(B) Timing for filing motion.—Any motion for a rehearing under
subparagraph (A) may only be filed within 15 days after the date on which
the Copyright Royalty Judges deliver to the participants in the proceeding
their initial determination.
(C) Participation by opposing party not required.—In any case
in which a rehearing is ordered, any opposing party shall not be required
to participate in the rehearing, except that nonparticipation may give rise
to the limitations with respect to judicial review provided for in subsection
(d)(1).
(D) No negative inference.—No negative inference shall be drawn
from lack of participation in a rehearing.
(E) Continuity of rates and terms.—(i) If the decision of the
Copyright Royalty Judges on any motion for a rehearing is not rendered
before the expiration of the statutory rates and terms that were previously
in effect, in the case of a proceeding to determine successors to rates and
terms that expire on a specified date, then—
(I) the initial determination of the Copyright Royalty Judges that
is the subject of the rehearing motion shall be effective as of the day
following the date on which the rates and terms that were previously
in effect expire; and
(II) in the case of a proceeding under section 114(f)(1)(C) or
114(f)(2)(C), royalty rates and terms shall, for purposes of section
114(f)(4)(B), be deemed to have been set at those rates and terms contained
in the initial determination of the Copyright Royalty Judges
that is the subject of the rehearing motion, as of the date of that
determination.
Copyright Law of the United States 209
Proceedings by Copyright Royalty Judges §803
(ii) The pendency of a motion for a rehearing under this paragraph shall
not relieve persons obligated to make royalty payments who would be affected
by the determination on that motion from providing the statements
of account and any reports of use, to the extent required, and paying the
royalties required under the relevant determination or regulations.
(iii) Notwithstanding clause (ii), whenever royalties described in
clause (ii) are paid to a person other than the Copyright Office, the entity
designated by the Copyright Royalty Judges to which such royalties
are paid by the copyright user (and any successor thereto) shall, within
60 days after the motion for rehearing is resolved or, if the motion is
granted, within 60 days after the rehearing is concluded, return any excess
amounts previously paid to the extent necessary to comply with
the final determination of royalty rates by the Copyright Royalty Judges.
Any underpayment of royalties resulting from a rehearing shall be paid
within the same period.
(3) Contents of determination.—A determination of the Copyright
Royalty Judges shall be supported by the written record and shall set forth the
findings of fact relied on by the Copyright Royalty Judges. Among other terms
adopted in a determination, the Copyright Royalty Judges may specify notice
and recordkeeping requirements of users of the copyrights at issue that apply
in lieu of those that would otherwise apply under regulations.
(4) Continuing jurisdiction.—The Copyright Royalty Judges may issue
an amendment to a written determination to correct any technical or clerical
errors in the determination or to modify the terms, but not the rates, of royalty
payments in response to unforeseen circumstances that would frustrate the
proper implementation of such determination. Such amendment shall be set
forth in a written addendum to the determination that shall be distributed to the
participants of the proceeding and shall be published in the Federal Register.
(5) Protective order.—The Copyright Royalty Judges may issue such
orders as may be appropriate to protect confidential information, including
orders excluding confidential information from the record of the determination
that is published or made available to the public, except that any terms or
rates of royalty payments or distributions may not be excluded.
(6) Publication of determination.—By no later than the end of the
60-day period provided in section 802(f)(1)(D), the Librarian of Congress
shall cause the determination, and any corrections thereto, to be published
in the Federal Register. The Librarian of Congress shall also publicize the determination
and corrections in such other manner as the Librarian considers
appropriate, including, but not limited to, publication on the Internet. The
Librarian of Congress shall also make the determination, corrections, and the
accompanying record available for public inspection and copying.
210 Copyright Law of the United States
§803 Proceedings by Copyright Royalty Judges
(7) Late payment.—A determination of the Copyright Royalty Judges may
include terms with respect to late payment, but in no way shall such terms
prevent the copyright holder from asserting other rights or remedies provided
under this title.
(d) Judicial Review.—
(1) Appeal.—Any determination of the Copyright Royalty Judges under
subsection (c) may, within 30 days after the publication of the determination
in the Federal Register, be appealed, to the United States Court of Appeals
for the District of Columbia Circuit, by any aggrieved participant in the
proceeding under subsection (b)(2) who fully participated in the proceeding
and who would be bound by the determination. Any participant that did
not participate in a rehearing may not raise any issue that was the subject of
that rehearing at any stage of judicial review of the hearing determination.
If no appeal is brought within that 30-day period, the determination of the
Copyright Royalty Judges shall be final, and the royalty fee or determination
with respect to the distribution of fees, as the case may be, shall take effect as
set forth in paragraph (2).
(2) Effect of rates.—
(A) Expiration on specified date.—When this title provides that
the royalty rates and terms that were previously in effect are to expire on a
specified date, any adjustment or determination by the Copyright Royalty
Judges of successor rates and terms for an ensuing statutory license period
shall be effective as of the day following the date of expiration of the rates
and terms that were previously in effect, even if the determination of the
Copyright Royalty Judges is rendered on a later date. A licensee shall be
obligated to continue making payments under the rates and terms previously
in effect until such time as rates and terms for the successor period are
established. Whenever royalties pursuant to this section are paid to a person
other than the Copyright Office, the entity designated by the Copyright
Royalty Judges to which such royalties are paid by the copyright user (and
any successor thereto) shall, within 60 days after the final determination of
the Copyright Royalty Judges establishing rates and terms for a successor
period or the exhaustion of all rehearings or appeals of such determination,
if any, return any excess amounts previously paid to the extent necessary to
comply with the final determination of royalty rates. Any underpayment
of royalties by a copyright user shall be paid to the entity designated by the
Copyright Royalty Judges within the same period.
(B) Other cases.—In cases where rates and terms have not, prior to
the inception of an activity, been established for that particular activity
under the relevant license, such rates and terms shall be retroactive to the
inception of activity under the relevant license covered by such rates and
terms. In other cases where rates and terms do not expire on a specified 
Copyright Law of the United States 211
Proceedings by Copyright Royalty Judges §803
date, successor rates and terms shall take effect on the first day of the second
month that begins after the publication of the determination of the
Copyright Royalty Judges in the Federal Register, except as otherwise provided
in this title, or by the Copyright Royalty Judges, or as agreed by the
participants in a proceeding that would be bound by the rates and terms.
Except as otherwise provided in this title, the rates and terms, to the extent
applicable, shall remain in effect until such successor rates and terms
become effective.
(C) Obligation to make payments.—
(i) The pendency of an appeal under this subsection shall not relieve
persons obligated to make royalty payments under section 111, 112, 114,
115, 116, 118, 119, or 1003, who would be affected by the determination
on appeal, from–
(I) providing the applicable statements of account and report of
use; and
(II) paying the royalties required under the relevant determination
or regulations.
(ii) Notwithstanding clause (i), whenever royalties described in clause (i)
are paid to a person other than the Copyright Office, the entity designated
by the Copyright Royalty Judges to which such royalties are paid
by the copyright user (and any successor thereto) shall, within 60 days
after the final resolution of the appeal, return any excess amounts previously
paid (and interest thereon, if ordered pursuant to paragraph (3))
to the extent necessary to comply with the final determination of royalty
rates on appeal. Any underpayment of royalties resulting from an
appeal (and interest thereon, if ordered pursuant to paragraph (3)) shall
be paid within the same period.
(3) Jurisdiction of court.—Section 706 of title 5 shall apply with respect
to review by the court of appeals under this subsection. If the court modifies or
vacates a determination of the Copyright Royalty Judges, the court may enter
its own determination with respect to the amount or distribution of royalty
fees and costs, and order the repayment of any excess fees, the payment of any
underpaid fees, and the payment of interest pertaining respectively thereto, in
accordance with its final judgment. The court may also vacate the determination
of the Copyright Royalty Judges and remand the case to the Copyright Royalty
Judges for further proceedings in accordance with subsection (a).
(e) Administrative Matters.—
(1) Deduction of costs of Library of Congress and Copyright
Office from filing fees.—
(A) Deduction from filing fees.—The Librarian of Congress may,
to the extent not otherwise provided under this title, deduct from the filing
fees collected under subsection (b) for a particular proceeding under this 
212 Copyright Law of the United States
§804 Proceedings by Copyright Royalty Judges
chapter the reasonable costs incurred by the Librarian of Congress, the
Copyright Office, and the Copyright Royalty Judges in conducting that
proceeding, other than the salaries of the Copyright Royalty Judges and
the 3 staff members appointed under section 802(b).
(B) Authorization of appropriations.—There are authorized to
be appropriated such sums as may be necessary to pay the costs incurred
under this chapter not covered by the filing fees collected under subsection
(b). All funds made available pursuant to this subparagraph shall remain
available until expended.
(2) Positions required for administration of compulsory licensing.—Section
307 of the Legislative Branch Appropriations Act, 1994,
shall not apply to employee positions in the Library of Congress that are required
to be filled in order to carry out section 111, 112, 114, 115, 116, 118, or 119
or chapter 10.

§901 Protection of Semiconductor Chip Products
§901 · Definitions
(a) As used in this chapter—
(1) a “semiconductor chip product” is the final or intermediate form of any
product—
(A) having two or more layers of metallic, insulating, or semiconductor
material, deposited or otherwise placed on, or etched away or otherwise
removed from, a piece of semiconductor material in accordance with a predetermined
pattern; and
(B) intended to perform electronic circuitry functions;
(2) a “mask work” is a series of related images, however fixed or encoded—
(A) having or representing the predetermined, three-dimensional pattern
of metallic, insulating, or semiconductor material present or removed
from the layers of a semiconductor chip product; and
(B) in which series the relation of the images to one another is that each
image has the pattern of the surface of one form of the semiconductor chip
product;
(3) a mask work is “fixed” in a semiconductor chip product when its embodiment
in the product is sufficiently permanent or stable to permit the mask
work to be perceived or reproduced from the product for a period of more
than transitory duration;
(4) to “distribute” means to sell, or to lease, bail, or otherwise transfer, or to
offer to sell, lease, bail, or otherwise transfer;
(5) to “commercially exploit” a mask work is to distribute to the public for
commercial purposes a semiconductor chip product embodying the mask
work; except that such term includes an offer to sell or transfer a semiconductor
chip product only when the offer is in writing and occurs after the mask
work is fixed in the semiconductor chip product;
(6) the “owner” of a mask work is the person who created the mask work,
the legal representative of that person if that person is deceased or under a
legal incapacity, or a party to whom all the rights under this chapter of such
person or representative are transferred in accordance with section 903(b);
except that, in the case of a work made within the scope of a person’s employment,
the owner is the employer for whom the person created the mask
work or a party to whom all the rights under this chapter of the employer are
transferred in accordance with section 903(b);
(7) an “innocent purchaser” is a person who purchases a semiconductor
chip product in good faith and without having notice of protection with respect
to the semiconductor chip product;
(8) having “notice of protection” means having actual knowledge that, or
reasonable grounds to believe that, a mask work is protected under this chapter;
and
Copyright Law of the United States 221
Protection of Semiconductor Chip Products §902
(9) an “infringing semiconductor chip product” is a semiconductor chip
product which is made, imported, or distributed in violation of the exclusive
rights of the owner of a mask work under this chapter.
(b) For purposes of this chapter, the distribution or importation of a product
incorporating a semiconductor chip product as a part thereof is a distribution or
importation of that semiconductor chip product.
§902 · Subject matter of protection3
(a)(1) Subject to the provisions of subsection (b), a mask work fixed in a semiconductor
chip product, by or under the authority of the owner of the mask work,
is eligible for protection under this chapter if—
(A) on the date on which the mask work is registered under section 908,
or is first commercially exploited anywhere in the world, whichever occurs
first, the owner of the mask work is (i) a national or domiciliary of the
United States, (ii) a national, domiciliary, or sovereign authority of a foreign
nation that is a party to a treaty affording protection to mask works to
which the United States is also a party, or (iii) a stateless person, wherever
that person may be domiciled;
(B) the mask work is first commercially exploited in the United States; or
(C) the mask work comes within the scope of a Presidential proclamation
issued under paragraph (2).
(2) Whenever the President finds that a foreign nation extends, to mask
works of owners who are nationals or domiciliaries of the United States protection
(A) on substantially the same basis as that on which the foreign nation
extends protection to mask works of its own nationals and domiciliaries and
mask works first commercially exploited in that nation, or (B) on substantially
the same basis as provided in this chapter, the President may by proclamation
extend protection under this chapter to mask works (i) of owners who are, on
the date on which the mask works are registered under section 908, or the
date on which the mask works are first commercially exploited anywhere in
the world, whichever occurs first, nationals, domiciliaries, or sovereign authorities
of that nation, or (ii) which are first commercially exploited in that
nation. The President may revise, suspend, or revoke any such proclamation
or impose any conditions or limitations on protection extended under any
such proclamation.
(b) Protection under this chapter shall not be available for a mask work that—
(1) is not original; or
(2) consists of designs that are staple, commonplace, or familiar in the semiconductor
industry, or variations of such designs, combined in a way that,
considered as a whole, is not original.
222 Copyright Law of the United States
§903 Protection of Semiconductor Chip Products
(c) In no case does protection under this chapter for a mask work extend to
any idea, procedure, process, system, method of operation, concept, principle, or
discovery, regardless of the form in which it is described, explained, illustrated,
or embodied in such work.
§903 · Ownership, transfer, licensing, and recordation
(a) The exclusive rights in a mask work subject to protection under this chapter
belong to the owner of the mask work.
(b) The owner of the exclusive rights in a mask work may transfer all of those
rights, or license all or less than all of those rights, by any written instrument
signed by such owner or a duly authorized agent of the owner. Such rights may be
transferred or licensed by operation of law, may be bequeathed by will, and may
pass as personal property by the applicable laws of intestate succession.
(c)(1) Any document pertaining to a mask work may be recorded in the Copyright
Office if the document filed for recordation bears the actual signature of the
person who executed it, or if it is accompanied by a sworn or official certification
that it is a true copy of the original, signed document. The Register of Copyrights
shall, upon receipt of the document and the fee specified pursuant to section
908(d), record the document and return it with a certificate of recordation.
The recordation of any transfer or license under this paragraph gives all persons
constructive notice of the facts stated in the recorded document concerning the
transfer or license.
(2) In any case in which conflicting transfers of the exclusive rights in a mask
work are made, the transfer first executed shall be void as against a subsequent
transfer which is made for a valuable consideration and without notice of the
first transfer, unless the first transfer is recorded in accordance with paragraph
(1) within three months after the date on which it is executed, but in no case
later than the day before the date of such subsequent transfer.
(d) Mask works prepared by an officer or employee of the United States Government
as part of that person’s official duties are not protected under this chapter, but
the United States Government is not precluded from receiving and holding exclusive
rights in mask works transferred to the Government under subsection (b).
§904 · Duration of protection
(a) The protection provided for a mask work under this chapter shall commence
on the date on which the mask work is registered under section 908, or
the date on which the mask work is first commercially exploited anywhere in the
world, whichever occurs first.

calendar year in which they would otherwise expire.
§905 · Exclusive rights in mask works
The owner of a mask work provided protection under this chapter has the
exclusive rights to do and to authorize any of the following:
(1) to reproduce the mask work by optical, electronic, or any other means;
(2) to import or distribute a semiconductor chip product in which the mask
work is embodied; and
(3) to induce or knowingly to cause another person to do any of the acts
described in paragraphs (1) and (2).
§906 · Limitation on exclusive rights: reverse engineering;
first sale
(a) Notwithstanding the provisions of section 905, it is not an infringement of
the exclusive rights of the owner of a mask work for—
(1) a person to reproduce the mask work solely for the purpose of teaching,
analyzing, or evaluating the concepts or techniques embodied in the mask
work or the circuitry, logic flow, or organization of components used in the
mask work; or
(2) a person who performs the analysis or evaluation described in paragraph
(1) to incorporate the results of such conduct in an original mask work
which is made to be distributed.
(b) Notwithstanding the provisions of section 905(2), the owner of a particular
semiconductor chip product made by the owner of the mask work, or by any
person authorized by the owner of the mask work, may import, distribute, or
otherwise dispose of or use, but not reproduce, that particular semiconductor
chip product without the authority of the owner of the mask work.
§907 · Limitation on exclusive rights: innocent infringement
(a) Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, an innocent purchaser
of an infringing semiconductor chip product—
224 Copyright Law of the United States
§908 Protection of Semiconductor Chip Products
(1) shall incur no liability under this chapter with respect to the importation
or distribution of units of the infringing semiconductor chip product that
occurs before the innocent purchaser has notice of protection with respect to
the mask work embodied in the semiconductor chip product; and
(2) shall be liable only for a reasonable royalty on each unit of the infringing
semiconductor chip product that the innocent purchaser imports or distributes
after having notice of protection with respect to the mask work embodied
in the semiconductor chip product.
(b) The amount of the royalty referred to in subsection (a)(2) shall be determined
by the court in a civil action for infringement unless the parties resolve the
issue by voluntary negotiation, mediation, or binding arbitration.
(c) The immunity of an innocent purchaser from liability referred to in subsection
(a)(1) and the limitation of remedies with respect to an innocent purchaser
referred to in subsection (a)(2) shall extend to any person who directly or indirectly
purchases an infringing semiconductor chip product from an innocent purchaser.
(d) The provisions of subsections (a), (b), and (c) apply only with respect to
those units of an infringing semiconductor chip product that an innocent purchaser
purchased before having notice of protection with respect to the mask
work embodied in the semiconductor chip product.
§908 · Registration of claims of protection
(a) The owner of a mask work may apply to the Register of Copyrights for
registration of a claim of protection in a mask work. Protection of a mask work
under this chapter shall terminate if application for registration of a claim of
protection in the mask work is not made as provided in this chapter within two
years after the date on which the mask work is first commercially exploited anywhere
in the world.
(b) The Register of Copyrights shall be responsible for all administrative functions
and duties under this chapter. Except for section 708, the provisions of chapter
7 of this title relating to the general responsibilities, organization, regulatory
authority, actions, records, and publications of the Copyright Office shall apply
to this chapter, except that the Register of Copyrights may make such changes as
may be necessary in applying those provisions to this chapter.
(c) The application for registration of a mask work shall be made on a form
prescribed by the Register of Copyrights. Such form may require any information
regarded by the Register as bearing upon the preparation or identification of the
mask work, the existence or duration of protection of the mask work under this
chapter, or ownership of the mask work. The application shall be accompanied
by the fee set pursuant to subsection (d) and the identifying material specified
pursuant to such subsection.
Copyright Law of the United States 225
Protection of Semiconductor Chip Products §909
(d) The Register of Copyrights shall by regulation set reasonable fees for the
filing of applications to register claims of protection in mask works under this
chapter, and for other services relating to the administration of this chapter or
the rights under this chapter, taking into consideration the cost of providing
those services, the benefits of a public record, and statutory fee schedules under
this title. The Register shall also specify the identifying material to be deposited
in connection with the claim for registration.
(e) If the Register of Copyrights, after examining an application for registration,
determines, in accordance with the provisions of this chapter, that the
application relates to a mask work which is entitled to protection under this
chapter, then the Register shall register the claim of protection and issue to the
applicant a certificate of registration of the claim of protection under the seal of
the Copyright Office. The effective date of registration of a claim of protection
shall be the date on which an application, deposit of identifying material, and fee,
which are determined by the Register of Copyrights or by a court of competent
jurisdiction to be acceptable for registration of the claim, have all been received
in the Copyright Office.
(f) In any action for infringement under this chapter, the certificate of registration
of a mask work shall constitute prima facie evidence (1) of the facts stated in
the certificate, and (2) that the applicant issued the certificate has met the requirements
of this chapter, and the regulations issued under this chapter, with respect
to the registration of claims.
(g) Any applicant for registration under this section who is dissatisfied with
the refusal of the Register of Copyrights to issue a certificate of registration under
this section may seek judicial review of that refusal by bringing an action for
such review in an appropriate United States district court not later than sixty
days after the refusal. The provisions of chapter 7 of title 5 shall apply to such
judicial review. The failure of the Register of Copyrights to issue a certificate of
registration within four months after an application for registration is filed shall
be deemed to be a refusal to issue a certificate of registration for purposes of this
subsection and section 910(b)(2), except that, upon a showing of good cause, the
district court may shorten such four-month period.
§909 · Mask work notice4
(a) The owner of a mask work provided protection under this chapter may
affix notice to the mask work, and to masks and semiconductor chip products
embodying the mask work, in such manner and location as to give reasonable notice
of such protection. The Register of Copyrights shall prescribe by regulation,
as examples, specific methods of affixation and positions of notice for purposes
of this section, but these specifications shall not be considered exhaustive. The 
226 Copyright Law of the United States
§910 Protection of Semiconductor Chip Products
affixation of such notice is not a condition of protection under this chapter, but
shall constitute prima facie evidence of notice of protection.
(b) The notice referred to in subsection (a) shall consist of—
(1) the words “mask work”, the symbol *M*, or the symbol µ (the letter M
in a circle); and
(2) the name of the owner or owners of the mask work or an abbreviation
by which the name is recognized or is generally known.
§910 · Enforcement of exclusive rights5
(a) Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, any person who violates any
of the exclusive rights of the owner of a mask work under this chapter, by conduct
in or affecting commerce, shall be liable as an infringer of such rights. As used in
this subsection, the term “any person” includes any State, any instrumentality of
a State, and any officer or employee of a State or instrumentality of a State acting
in his or her official capacity. Any State, and any such instrumentality, officer, or
employee, shall be subject to the provisions of this chapter in the same manner
and to the same extent as any nongovernmental entity.
(b)(1) The owner of a mask work protected under this chapter, or the exclusive
licensee of all rights under this chapter with respect to the mask work, shall, after
a certificate of registration of a claim of protection in that mask work has been issued
under section 908, be entitled to institute a civil action for any infringement
with respect to the mask work which is committed after the commencement of
protection of the mask work under section 904(a).
(2) In any case in which an application for registration of a claim of protection
in a mask work and the required deposit of identifying material and
fee have been received in the Copyright Office in proper form and registration
of the mask work has been refused, the applicant is entitled to institute
a civil action for infringement under this chapter with respect to the mask
work if notice of the action, together with a copy of the complaint, is served
on the Register of Copyrights, in accordance with the Federal Rules of Civil
Procedure. The Register may, at his or her option, become a party to the action
with respect to the issue of whether the claim of protection is eligible for
registration by entering an appearance within sixty days after such service,
but the failure of the Register to become a party to the action shall not deprive
the court of jurisdiction to determine that issue.
(c)(1) The Secretary of the Treasury and the United States Postal Service shall
separately or jointly issue regulations for the enforcement of the rights set forth
in section 905 with respect to importation. These regulations may require, as a
condition for the exclusion of articles from the United States, that the person
seeking exclusion take any one or more of the following actions:
Copyright Law of the United States 227
Protection of Semiconductor Chip Products §911
(A) Obtain a court order enjoining, or an order of the International
Trade Commission under section 337 of the Tariff Act of 1930 excluding,
importation of the articles.
(B) Furnish proof that the mask work involved is protected under this
chapter and that the importation of the articles would infringe the rights
in the mask work under this chapter.
(C) Post a surety bond for any injury that may result if the detention or
exclusion of the articles proves to be unjustified.
(2) Articles imported in violation of the rights set forth in section 905 are
subject to seizure and forfeiture in the same manner as property imported in
violation of the customs laws. Any such forfeited articles shall be destroyed
as directed by the Secretary of the Treasury or the court, as the case may be,
except that the articles may be returned to the country of export whenever it
is shown to the satisfaction of the Secretary of the Treasury that the importer
had no reasonable grounds for believing that his or her acts constituted a
violation of the law.
§911 · Civil actions6
(a) Any court having jurisdiction of a civil action arising under this chapter
may grant temporary restraining orders, preliminary injunctions, and permanent
injunctions on such terms as the court may deem reasonable to prevent or
restrain infringement of the exclusive rights in a mask work under this chapter.
(b) Upon finding an infringer liable, to a person entitled under section
910(b)(1) to institute a civil action, for an infringement of any exclusive right
under this chapter, the court shall award such person actual damages suffered
by the person as a result of the infringement. The court shall also award such
person the infringer’s profits that are attributable to the infringement and are
not taken into account in computing the award of actual damages. In establishing
the infringer’s profits, such person is required to present proof only of
the infringer’s gross revenue, and the infringer is required to prove his or her
deductible expenses and the elements of profit attributable to factors other
than the mask work.
(c) At any time before final judgment is rendered, a person entitled to institute
a civil action for infringement may elect, instead of actual damages and profits
as provided by subsection (b), an award of statutory damages for all infringements
involved in the action, with respect to any one mask work for which any
one infringer is liable individually, or for which any two or more infringers are
liable jointly and severally, in an amount not more than $250,000 as the court
considers just.
228 Copyright Law of the United States
§912 Protection of Semiconductor Chip Products
(d) An action for infringement under this chapter shall be barred unless the
action is commenced within three years after the claim accrues.
(e)(1) At any time while an action for infringement of the exclusive rights in a
mask work under this chapter is pending, the court may order the impounding,
on such terms as it may deem reasonable, of all semiconductor chip products, and
any drawings, tapes, masks, or other products by means of which such products
may be reproduced, that are claimed to have been made, imported, or used in
violation of those exclusive rights. Insofar as practicable, applications for orders
under this paragraph shall be heard and determined in the same manner as an
application for a temporary restraining order or preliminary injunction.
(2) As part of a final judgment or decree, the court may order the destruction
or other disposition of any infringing semiconductor chip products, and
any masks, tapes, or other articles by means of which such products may be
reproduced.
(f) In any civil action arising under this chapter, the court in its discretion
may allow the recovery of full costs, including reasonable attorneys’ fees, to the
prevailing party.
(g)(1) Any State, any instrumentality of a State, and any officer or employee of
a State or instrumentality of a State acting in his or her official capacity, shall not
be immune, under the Eleventh Amendment of the Constitution of the United
States or under any other doctrine of sovereign immunity, from suit in Federal
court by any person, including any governmental or nongovernmental entity, for
a violation of any of the exclusive rights of the owner of a mask work under this
chapter, or for any other violation under this chapter.
(2) In a suit described in paragraph (1) for a violation described in that
paragraph, remedies (including remedies both at law and in equity) are available
for the violation to the same extent as such remedies are available for
such a violation in a suit against any public or private entity other than a State,
instrumentality of a State, or officer or employee of a State acting in his or
her official capacity. Such remedies include actual damages and profits under
subsection (b), statutory damages under subsection (c), impounding and disposition
of infringing articles under subsection (e), and costs and attorney’s
fees under subsection (f).
§912 · Relation to other laws7
(a) Nothing in this chapter shall affect any right or remedy held by any person
under chapters 1 through 8 or 10 of this title, or under title 35.
(b) Except as provided in section 908(b) of this title, references to “this title”
or “title 17” in chapters 1 through 8 or 10 of this title shall be deemed not to apply
to this chapter.
Copyright Law of the United States 229
Protection of Semiconductor Chip Products §913
(c) The provisions of this chapter shall preempt the laws of any State to the
extent those laws provide any rights or remedies with respect to a mask work
which are equivalent to those rights or remedies provided by this chapter, except
that such preemption shall be effective only with respect to actions filed on or
after January 1, 1986.
(d) Notwithstanding subsection (c), nothing in this chapter shall detract
from any rights of a mask work owner, whether under Federal law (exclusive of
this chapter) or under the common law or the statutes of a State, heretofore or
hereafter declared or enacted, with respect to any mask work first commercially
exploited before July 1, 1983.
§913 · Transitional provisions
(a) No application for registration under section 908 may be filed, and no civil
action under section 910 or other enforcement proceeding under this chapter
may be instituted, until sixty days after the date of the enactment of this chapter.
(b) No monetary relief under section 911 may be granted with respect to any
conduct that occurred before the date of the enactment of this chapter, except as
provided in subsection (d).
(c) Subject to subsection (a), the provisions of this chapter apply to all mask
works that are first commercially exploited or are registered under this chapter,
or both, on or after the date of the enactment of this chapter.
(d)(1) Subject to subsection (a), protection is available under this chapter to any
mask work that was first commercially exploited on or after July 1, 1983, and before
the date of the enactment of this chapter, if a claim of protection in the mask
work is registered in the Copyright Office before July 1, 1985, under section 908.
(2) In the case of any mask work described in paragraph (1) that is provided
protection under this chapter, infringing semiconductor chip product units
manufactured before the date of the enactment of this chapter may, without
liability under sections 910 and 911, be imported into or distributed in the
United States, or both, until two years after the date of registration of the mask
work under section 908, but only if the importer or distributor, as the case
may be, first pays or offers to pay the reasonable royalty referred to in section
907(a)(2) to the mask work owner, on all such units imported or distributed,
or both, after the date of the enactment of this chapter.
(3) In the event that a person imports or distributes infringing semiconductor
chip product units described in paragraph (2) of this subsection without
first paying or offering to pay the reasonable royalty specified in such paragraph,
or if the person refuses or fails to make such payment, the mask work
owner shall be entitled to the relief provided in sections 910 and 911.

§914 Protection of Semiconductor Chip Products
§914 · International transitional provisions8
(a) Notwithstanding the conditions set forth in subparagraphs (A) and (C) of
section 902(a)(1) with respect to the availability of protection under this chapter
to nationals, domiciliaries, and sovereign authorities of a foreign nation, the
Secretary of Commerce may, upon the petition of any person, or upon the Secretary’s
own motion, issue an order extending protection under this chapter to such
foreign nationals, domiciliaries, and sovereign authorities if the Secretary finds—
(1) that the foreign nation is making good faith efforts and reasonable progress
toward—
(A) entering into a treaty described in section 902(a)(1)(A); or
(B) enacting or implementing legislation that would be in compliance
with subparagraph (A) or (B) of section 902(a)(2); and
(2) that the nationals, domiciliaries, and sovereign authorities of the foreign
nation, and persons controlled by them, are not engaged in the misappropriation,
or unauthorized distribution or commercial exploitation, of mask works;
and
(3) that issuing the order would promote the purposes of this chapter and
international comity with respect to the protection of mask works.
(b) While an order under subsection (a) is in effect with respect to a foreign
nation, no application for registration of a claim for protection in a mask work
under this chapter may be denied solely because the owner of the mask work is
a national, domiciliary, or sovereign authority of that foreign nation, or solely
because the mask work was first commercially exploited in that foreign nation.
(c) Any order issued by the Secretary of Commerce under subsection (a) shall
be effective for such a period as the Secretary designates in the order, except that
no such order may be effective after that date on which the authority of the Secretary
of Commerce terminates under subsection (e). The effective date of any
such order shall also be designated in the order. In the case of an order issued
upon the petition of a person, such effective date may be no earlier than the date
on which the Secretary receives such petition.
(d)(1) Any order issued under this section shall terminate if—
(A) the Secretary of Commerce finds that any of the conditions set forth
in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of subsection (a) no longer exist; or
(B) mask works of nationals, domiciliaries, and sovereign authorities
of that foreign nation or mask works first commercially exploited in that
foreign nation become eligible for protection under subparagraph (A) or
(C) of section 902(a)(1).
(2) Upon the termination or expiration of an order issued under this section,
registrations of claims of protection in mask works made pursuant to that
order shall remain valid for the period specified in section 904.

With respect to a digital audio recording device first distributed in combination
with one or more devices, either as a physically integrated unit or as
separate components, the royalty payment shall be calculated as follows:
(A) If the digital audio recording device and such other devices are part
of a physically integrated unit, the royalty payment shall be based on the
transfer price of the unit, but shall be reduced by any royalty payment made
on any digital audio recording device included within the unit that was not
first distributed in combination with the unit.
(B) If the digital audio recording device is not part of a physically integrated
unit and substantially similar devices have been distributed separately
at any time during the preceding 4 calendar quarters, the royalty
payment shall be based on the average transfer price of such devices during
those 4 quarters.
(C) If the digital audio recording device is not part of a physically integrated
unit and substantially similar devices have not been distributed
separately at any time during the preceding 4 calendar quarters, the royalty
payment shall be based on a constructed price reflecting the proportional
value of such device to the combination as a whole.

Digital Audio Recording Devices and Media § 1006
(3) Limits on royalties.—Notwithstanding paragraph (1) or (2), the
amount of the royalty payment for each digital audio recording device shall not
be less than $1 nor more than the royalty maximum. The royalty maximum shall
be $8 per device, except that in the case of a physically integrated unit containing
more than 1 digital audio recording device, the royalty maximum for such unit
shall be $12. During the 6th year after the effective date of this chapter, and
not more than once each year thereafter, any interested copyright party may
petition the Copyright Royalty Judges to increase the royalty maximum and, if
more than 20 percent of the royalty payments are at the relevant royalty maximum,
the Copyright Royalty Judges shall prospectively increase such royalty
maximum with the goal of having no more than 10 percent of such payments
at the new royalty maximum; however the amount of any such increase as a
percentage of the royalty maximum shall in no event exceed the percentage
increase in the Consumer Price Index during the period under review.
(b) Digital Audio Recording Media.—The royalty payment due under
section 1003 for each digital audio recording medium imported into and distributed
in the United States, or manufactured and distributed in the United States,

States as offsetting receipts, in such manner as the Secretary of the Treasury directs.
All funds held by the Secretary of the Treasury shall be invested in interestbearing
United States securities for later distribution with interest under section
1007. The Register may, in the Register’s discretion, 4 years after the close of any
calendar year, close out the royalty payments account for that calendar year, and
may treat any funds remaining in such account and any subsequent deposits that
would otherwise be attributable to that calendar year as attributable to the succeeding
calendar year.

any successor entity) to be distributed to nonfeatured vocalists (whether or
not members of the American Federation of Television and Radio Artists
or any successor entity) who have performed on sound recordings distributed
in the United States. 40 percent of the remaining royalty payments in
the Sound Recordings Fund shall be distributed to the interested copyright
parties described in section 1001(7)(C), and 60 percent of such remaining
royalty payments shall be distributed to the interested copyright parties
described in section 1001(7)(A).

(2) Negotiations.—Notwithstanding any provision of the antitrust laws,
for purposes of this section interested copyright parties within each group
specified in section 1006(b) may agree among themselves to the proportionate
division of royalty payments, may lump their claims together and file them
jointly or as a single claim, or may designate a common agent, including any
organization described in section 1001(7)(D), to negotiate or receive payment
on their behalf; except that no agreement under this subsection may modify
the allocation of royalties specified in section 1006(b).
(b) Distribution of Payments in the Absence of a Dispute.—After
the period established for the filing of claims under subsection (a), in each year,
the Copyright Royalty Judges shall determine whether there exists a controversy
concerning the distribution of royalty payments under section 1006(c). If the
Copyright Royalty Judges determine that no such controversy exists, the Copyright
Royalty Judges shall, within 30 days after such determination, authorize the
distribution of the royalty payments as set forth in the agreements regarding the
distribution of royalty payments entered into pursuant to subsection (a). The
Librarian of Congress shall, before such royalty payments are distributed, deduct
the reasonable administrative costs incurred under this section.
(c) Resolution of Disputes.—If the Copyright Royalty Judges find the
existence of a controversy, the Copyright Royalty Judges shall, pursuant to chapter
8 of this title, conduct a proceeding to determine the distribution of royalty payments.
During the pendency of such a proceeding, the Copyright Royalty Judges
shall withhold from distribution an amount sufficient to satisfy all claims with
respect to which a controversy exists, but shall, to the extent feasible, authorize
the distribution of any amounts that are not in controversy. The Librarian of

§1201 Copyright Protection and Management Systems
§1201 · Circumvention of copyright protection systems2
(a) Violations Regarding Circumvention of Technological Measures.—(1)(A)
No person shall circumvent a technological measure that effectively
controls access to a work protected under this title. The prohibition contained
in the preceding sentence shall take effect at the end of the 2-year period
beginning on the date of the enactment of this chapter.
(B) The prohibition contained in subparagraph (A) shall not apply to
persons who are users of a copyrighted work which is in a particular class
of works, if such persons are, or are likely to be in the succeeding 3-year
period, adversely affected by virtue of such prohibition in their ability to
make noninfringing uses of that particular class of works under this title,
as determined under subparagraph (C).
(C) During the 2-year period described in subparagraph (A), and during
each succeeding 3-year period, the Librarian of Congress, upon the recommendation
of the Register of Copyrights, who shall consult with the Assistant
Secretary for Communications and Information of the Department
of Commerce and report and comment on his or her views in making such
recommendation, shall make the determination in a rulemaking proceeding
for purposes of subparagraph (B) of whether persons who are users of a
copyrighted work are, or are likely to be in the succeeding 3-year period, adversely
affected by the prohibition under subparagraph (A) in their ability to
make noninfringing uses under this title of a particular class of copyrighted
works. In conducting such rulemaking, the Librarian shall examine—
(i) the availability for use of copyrighted works;
(ii) the availability for use of works for nonprofit archival, preservation,
and educational purposes;
(iii) the impact that the prohibition on the circumvention of technological
measures applied to copyrighted works has on criticism, comment,
news reporting, teaching, scholarship, or research;
(iv) the effect of circumvention of technological measures on the
market for or value of copyrighted works; and
(v) such other factors as the Librarian considers appropriate.
(D) The Librarian shall publish any class of copyrighted works for which
the Librarian has determined, pursuant to the rulemaking conducted under
subparagraph (C), that noninfringing uses by persons who are users of a
copyrighted work are, or are likely to be, adversely affected, and the prohibition
contained in subparagraph (A) shall not apply to such users with
respect to such class of works for the ensuing 3-year period.
(E) Neither the exception under subparagraph (B) from the applicability
of the prohibition contained in subparagraph (A), nor any determination
made in a rulemaking conducted under subparagraph (C), may be used as 
Copyright Law of the United States 251
Copyright Protection and Management Systems §1201
a defense in any action to enforce any provision of this title other than this
paragraph.
(2) No person shall manufacture, import, offer to the public, provide, or
otherwise traffic in any technology, product, service, device, component, or
part thereof, that—
(A) is primarily designed or produced for the purpose of circumventing
a technological measure that effectively controls access to a work protected
under this title;
(B) has only limited commercially significant purpose or use other than
to circumvent a technological measure that effectively controls access to a
work protected under this title; or
(C) is marketed by that person or another acting in concert with that
person with that person’s knowledge for use in circumventing a technological
measure that effectively controls access to a work protected under
this title.
(3) As used in this subsection—
(A) to “circumvent a technological measure” means to descramble a
scrambled work, to decrypt an encrypted work, or otherwise to avoid, bypass,
remove, deactivate, or impair a technological measure, without the
authority of the copyright owner; and
(B) a technological measure “effectively controls access to a work” if the
measure, in the ordinary course of its operation, requires the application
of information, or a process or a treatment, with the authority of the copyright
owner, to gain access to the work.
(b) Additional Violations.—(1) No person shall manufacture, import, offer
to the public, provide, or otherwise traffic in any technology, product, service,
device, component, or part thereof, that—
(A) is primarily designed or produced for the purpose of circumventing
protection afforded by a technological measure that effectively protects a
right of a copyright owner under this title in a work or a portion thereof;
(B) has only limited commercially significant purpose or use other than
to circumvent protection afforded by a technological measure that effectively
protects a right of a copyright owner under this title in a work or a
portion thereof; or
(C) is marketed by that person or another acting in concert with that
person with that person’s knowledge for use in circumventing protection
afforded by a technological measure that effectively protects a right of a
copyright owner under this title in a work or a portion thereof.
(2) As used in this subsection—
(A) to “circumvent protection afforded by a technological measure”
means avoiding, bypassing, removing, deactivating, or otherwise impairing
a technological measure; and
252 Copyright Law of the United States
§1201 Copyright Protection and Management Systems
(B) a technological measure “effectively protects a right of a copyright
owner under this title” if the measure, in the ordinary course of its operation,
prevents, restricts, or otherwise limits the exercise of a right of a copyright
owner under this title.
(c) Other Rights, Etc., Not Affected.—(1) Nothing in this section shall
affect rights, remedies, limitations, or defenses to copyright infringement, including
fair use, under this title.

which gains access to a commercially exploited copyrighted work solely in order
to make a good faith determination of whether to acquire a copy of that work
for the sole purpose of engaging in conduct permitted under this title shall not
be in violation of subsection (a)(1)(A). A copy of a work to which access has been
gained under this paragraph—
(A) may not be retained longer than necessary to make such good faith
determination; and
(B) may not be used for any other purpose.
(2) The exemption made available under paragraph (1) shall only apply
with respect to a work when an identical copy of that work is not reasonably
available in another form.
(3) A nonprofit library, archives, or educational institution that willfully
for the purpose of commercial advantage or financial gain violates paragraph
(1)—
(A) shall, for the first offense, be subject to the civil remedies under section
1203; and
(B) shall, for repeated or subsequent offenses, in addition to the civil remedies
under section 1203, forfeit the exemption provided under paragraph (1).
(4) This subsection may not be used as a defense to a claim under subsection
(a)(2) or (b), nor may this subsection permit a nonprofit library, archives,

of a government computer, computer system, or computer network.
(f) Reverse Engineering.—(1) Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection
(a)(1)(A), a person who has lawfully obtained the right to use a copy of
a computer program may circumvent a technological measure that effectively
controls access to a particular portion of that program for the sole purpose of
identifying and analyzing those elements of the program that are necessary to
achieve interoperability of an independently created computer program with
other programs, and that have not previously been readily available to the person
engaging in the circumvention, to the extent any such acts of identification and
analysis do not constitute infringement under this title.
(2) Notwithstanding the provisions of subsections (a)(2) and (b), a person may
develop and employ technological means to circumvent a technological measure,
or to circumvent protection afforded by a technological measure, in order to
enable the identification and analysis under paragraph (1), or for the purpose of
enabling interoperability of an independently created computer program with
other programs, if such means are necessary to achieve such interoperability, to
the extent that doing so does not constitute infringement under this title.
(3) The information acquired through the acts permitted under paragraph
(1), and the means permitted under paragraph (2), may be made available to
others if the person referred to in paragraph (1) or (2), as the case may be, provides
such information or means solely for the purpose of enabling interoperability
of an independently created computer program with other programs,
and to the extent that doing so does not constitute infringement under this
title or violate applicable law other than this section.
(4) For purposes of this subsection, the term “interoperability” means the

useful article which makes the article attractive or distinctive in appearance
to the purchasing or using public may secure the protection provided by this
chapter upon complying with and subject to this chapter.
(2) Vessel features.—The design of a vessel hull, deck, or combination
of a hull and deck, including a plug or mold, is subject to protection under
this chapter, notwithstanding section 1302(4).
(3) Exceptions.—Department of Defense rights in a registered design under
this chapter, including the right to build to such registered design, shall be
determined solely by operation of section 2320 of title 10 or by the instrument
under which the design was developed for the United States Government.
(b) Definitions.—For the purpose of this chapter, the following terms have
the following meanings:
(1) A design is “original” if it is the result of the designer’s creative endeavor
that provides a distinguishable variation over prior work pertaining to similar
articles which is more than merely trivial and has not been copied from
another source.
(2) A “useful article” is a vessel hull or deck, including a plug or mold, which
in normal use has an intrinsic utilitarian function that is not merely to portray
the appearance of the article or to convey information. An article which normally
is part of a useful article shall be deemed to be a useful article.
(3) A “vessel” is a craft—
(A) that is designed and capable of independently steering a course on
or through water through its own means of propulsion; and
(B) that is designed and capable of carrying and transporting one or
more passengers.

superstructure, masts, sails, yards, rigging, hardware, fixtures, and other
attachments.
(5) A “plug” means a device or model used to make a mold for the purpose
of exact duplication, regardless of whether the device or model has an intrinsic
utilitarian function that is not only to portray the appearance of the product
or to convey information.
(6) A “mold” means a matrix or form in which a substance for material
is used, regardless of whether the matrix or form has an intrinsic utilitarian
function that is not only to portray the appearance of the product or to convey
information.

owner in the United States or a foreign country more than 2 years before the
date of the application for registration under this chapter.
§1303 · Revisions, adaptations, and rearrangements
Protection for a design under this chapter shall be available notwithstanding
the employment in the design of subject matter excluded from protection under
section 1302 if the design is a substantial revision, adaptation, or rearrangement
of such subject matter. Such protection shall be independent of any subsisting
protection in subject matter employed in the design, and shall not be construed as
securing any right to subject matter excluded from protection under this chapter
or as extending any subsisting protection under this chapter.
§1304 · Commencement of protection
The protection provided for a design under this chapter shall commence upon
the earlier of the date of publication of the registration under section 1313(a) or
the date the design is first made public as defined by section 1310(b).

to the end of the calendar year in which they would otherwise expire.
(c) Termination of Rights.—Upon expiration or termination of protection
in a particular design under this chapter, all rights under this chapter in the
design shall terminate, regardless of the number of different articles in which the
design may have been used during the term of its protection.
§1306 · Design notice
(a) Contents of Design Notice.—
(1) Whenever any design for which protection is sought under this chapter
is made public under section 1310(b), the owner of the design shall, subject to
the provisions of section 1307, mark it or have it marked legibly with a design
notice consisting of—
(A) the words “Protected Design”, the abbreviation “Prot’d Des.”, or the
letter “D” within a circle, ∂, or the symbol “*D*”;
(B) the year of the date on which protection for the design commenced; and
(C) the name of the owner, an abbreviation by which the name can be
recognized, or a generally accepted alternative designation of the owner.
Any distinctive identification of the owner may be used for purposes of subparagraph
(C) if it has been recorded by the Administrator before the design marked
with such identification is registered.
(2) After registration, the registration number may be used instead of the
elements specified in subparagraphs (B) and (C) of paragraph (1).
(b) Location of Notice.—The design notice shall be so located and applied
as to give reasonable notice of design protection while the useful article embodying
the design is passing through its normal channels of commerce.

complied with the provisions of this section, protection under this chapter shall
not be affected by the removal, destruction, or obliteration by others of the design

Protection of Original Designs §1309
§1307 · Effect of omission of notice
(a) Actions with Notice.—Except as provided in subsection (b), the omission
of the notice prescribed in section 1306 shall not cause loss of the protection
under this chapter or prevent recovery for infringement under this chapter
against any person who, after receiving written notice of the design protection,
begins an undertaking leading to infringement under this chapter.
(b) Actions without Notice.—The omission of the notice prescribed in
section 1306 shall prevent any recovery under section 1323 against a person who
began an undertaking leading to infringement under this chapter before receiving
written notice of the design protection. No injunction shall be issued under
this chapter with respect to such undertaking unless the owner of the design reimburses
that person for any reasonable expenditure or contractual obligation
in connection with such undertaking that was incurred before receiving written
notice of the design protection, as the court in its discretion directs. The burden of
providing written notice of design protection shall be on the owner of the design.
§1308 · Exclusive rights
The owner of a design protected under this chapter has the exclusive right to—
(1) make, have made, or import, for sale or for use in trade, any useful article
embodying that design; and
(2) sell or distribute for sale or for use in trade any useful article embodying
that design.
§1309 · Infringement
(a) Acts of Infringement.—Except as provided in subsection (b), it shall
be infringement of the exclusive rights in a design protected under this chapter
for any person, without the consent of the owner of the design, within the United
States and during the term of such protection, to—
(1) make, have made, or import, for sale or for use in trade, any infringing
article as defined in subsection (e); or
(2) sell or distribute for sale or for use in trade any such infringing article.
(b) Acts of Sellers and Distributors.—A seller or distributor of an infringing
article who did not make or import the article shall be deemed to have
infringed on a design protected under this chapter only if that person—
(1) induced or acted in collusion with a manufacturer to make, or an importer
to import such article, except that merely purchasing or giving an order
to purchase such article in the ordinary course of business shall not of itself 
270 Copyright Law of the United States
§1310 Protection of Original Designs
constitute such inducement or collusion; or
(2) refused or failed, upon the request of the owner of the design, to make
a prompt and full disclosure of that person’s source of such article, and that
person orders or reorders such article after receiving notice by registered or
certified mail of the protection subsisting in the design.
(c) Acts without Knowledge.—It shall not be infringement under this
section to make, have made, import, sell, or distribute, any article embodying a
design which was created without knowledge that a design was protected under
this chapter and was copied from such protected design.
(d) Acts in Ordinary Course of Business.—A person who incorporates
into that person’s product of manufacture an infringing article acquired from
others in the ordinary course of business, or who, without knowledge of the protected
design embodied in an infringing article, makes or processes the infringing
article for the account of another person in the ordinary course of business, shall
not be deemed to have infringed the rights in that design under this chapter except
under a condition contained in paragraph (1) or (2) of subsection (b). Accepting
an order or reorder from the source of the infringing article shall be deemed
ordering or reordering within the meaning of subsection (b)(2).

article” is any article the design of which has been copied from a design protected
under this chapter, without the consent of the owner of the protected design. An
infringing article is not an illustration or picture of a protected design in an advertisement,
book, periodical, newspaper, photograph, broadcast, motion picture,
or similar medium. A design shall not be deemed to have been copied from a
protected design if it is original and not substantially similar in appearance to a
protected design.
(f) Establishing Originality.—The party to any action or proceeding
under this chapter who alleges rights under this chapter in a design shall have
the burden of establishing the design’s originality whenever the opposing party
introduces an earlier work which is identical to such design, or so similar as to
make prima facie showing that such design was copied from such work.
(g) Reproduction for Teaching or Analysis.—It is not an infringement
of the exclusive rights of a design owner for a person to reproduce the design in
a useful article or in any other form solely for the purpose of teaching, analyzing,
or evaluating the appearance, concepts, or techniques embodied in the design, or
the function of the useful article embodying the design.
§1310 · Application for registration
(a) Time Limit for Application for Registration.—Protection under
this chapter shall be lost if application for registration of the design is not made 
Copyright Law of the United States 271
Protection of Original Designs §1310
within 2 years after the date on which the design is first made public.
(b) When Design Is Made Public.—A design is made public when an existing
useful article embodying the design is anywhere publicly exhibited, publicly
distributed, or offered for sale or sold to the public by the owner of the design or
with the owner’s consent.
(c) Application by Owner of Design.—Application for registration may
be made by the owner of the design.
(d) Contents of Application.—The application for registration shall be

earlier than the date of the application;
(5) affirmation that the design has been fixed in a useful article; and
(6) such other information as may be required by the Administrator.
The application for registration may include a description setting forth the salient
features of the design, but the absence of such a description shall not prevent
registration under this chapter.
(e) Sworn Statement.—The application for registration shall be accompanied
by a statement under oath by the applicant or the applicant’s duly authorized
agent or representative, setting forth, to the best of the applicant’s knowledge and
belief—
(1) that the design is original and was created by the designer or designers
named in the application;
(2) that the design has not previously been registered on behalf of the applicant
or the applicant’s predecessor in title; and
(3) that the applicant is the person entitled to protection and to registration
under this chapter.
If the design has been made public with the design notice prescribed in section
1306, the statement shall also describe the exact form and position of the
design notice.
(f) Effect of Errors.—(1) Error in any statement or assertion as to the utility
of the useful article named in the application under this section, the design
of which is sought to be registered, shall not affect the protection secured under
this chapter.
(2) Errors in omitting a joint designer or in naming an alleged joint designer
shall not affect the validity of the registration, or the actual ownership
or the protection of the design, unless it is shown that the error occurred with
deceptive intent.
(g) Design Made in Scope of Employment.—In a case in which the design
was made within the regular scope of the designer’s employment and individual 
272 Copyright Law of the United States
§1311 Protection of Original Designs
authorship of the design is difficult or impossible to ascribe and the application
so states, the name and address of the employer for whom the design was made
may be stated instead of that of the individual designer.
(h) Pictorial Representation of Design.—The application for registration
shall be accompanied by two copies of a drawing or other pictorial representation
of the useful article embodying the design, having one or more views,
adequate to show the design, in a form and style suitable for reproduction, which
shall be deemed a part of the application.
(i) Design in More than One Useful Article.—If the distinguishing
elements of a design are in substantially the same form in different useful articles,
the design shall be protected as to all such useful articles when protected as to
one of them, but not more than one registration shall be required for the design.
(j) Application for More than One Design.—More than one design
may be included in the same application under such conditions as may be
prescribed by the Administrator. For each design included in an application the
fee prescribed for a single design shall be paid.

person who has, or whose legal representative or predecessor or successor in title
has, previously filed an application for registration of the same design in a foreign
country which extends to designs of owners who are citizens of the United States,
or to applications filed under this chapter, similar protection to that provided
under this chapter shall have that same effect as if filed in the United States on
the date on which the application was first filed in such foreign country, if the
application in the United States is filed within 6 months after the earliest date on
which any such foreign application was filed.
§1312 · Oaths and acknowledgments
(a) In General.—Oaths and acknowledgments required by this chapter—
(1) may be made—
(A) before any person in the United States authorized by law to administer
oaths; or
(B) when made in a foreign country, before any diplomatic or consular
officer of the United States authorized to administer oaths, or before any
official authorized to administer oaths in the foreign country concerned,
whose authority shall be proved by a certificate of a diplomatic or consular
officer of the United States; and
Copyright Law of the United States 273
Protection of Original Designs §1313
(2) shall be valid if they comply with the laws of the State or country where
made.
(b) Written Declaration in Lieu of Oath.—(1) The Administrator may
by rule prescribe that any document which is to be filed under this chapter in
the Office of the Administrator and which is required by any law, rule, or other
regulation to be under oath, may be subscribed to by a written declaration in such
form as the Administrator may prescribe, and such declaration shall be in lieu of
the oath otherwise required.
(2) Whenever a written declaration under paragraph (1) is used, the document
containing the declaration shall state that willful false statements are
punishable by fine or imprisonment, or both, pursuant to section 1001 of
title 18, and may jeopardize the validity of the application or document or a
registration resulting therefrom.
§1313 · Examination of application and issue or refusal
of registration4
(a) Determination of Registrability of Design; Registration.—
Upon the filing of an application for registration in proper form under section
1310, and upon payment of the fee prescribed under section 1316, the Administrator
shall determine whether or not the application relates to a design
which on its face appears to be subject to protection under this chapter, and,
if so, the Register shall register the design. Registration under this subsection
shall be announced by publication. The date of registration shall be the date of
publication.
(b) Refusal to Register; Reconsideration.—If, in the judgment of the
Administrator, the application for registration relates to a design which on its face
is not subject to protection under this chapter, the Administrator shall send to the
applicant a notice of refusal to register and the grounds for the refusal. Within
3 months after the date on which the notice of refusal is sent, the applicant may,
by written request, seek reconsideration of the application. After consideration
of such a request, the Administrator shall either register the design or send to the
applicant a notice of final refusal to register.
(c) Application to Cancel Registration.—Any person who believes he
or she is or will be damaged by a registration under this chapter may, upon payment
of the prescribed fee, apply to the Administrator at any time to cancel the
registration on the ground that the design is not subject to protection under this
chapter, stating the reasons for the request. Upon receipt of an application for
cancellation, the Administrator shall send to the owner of the design, as shown
in the records of the Office of the Administrator, a notice of the application, and
the owner shall have a period of 3 months after the date on which such notice is 
274 Copyright Law of the United States
§1314 Protection of Original Designs
mailed in which to present arguments to the Administrator for support of the
validity of the registration. The Administrator shall also have the authority to
establish, by regulation, conditions under which the opposing parties may appear
and be heard in support of their arguments. If, after the periods provided
for the presentation of arguments have expired, the Administrator determines
that the applicant for cancellation has established that the design is not subject
to protection under this chapter, the Administrator shall order the registration
stricken from the record. Cancellation under this subsection shall be announced
by publication, and notice of the Administrator’s final determination with respect
to any application for cancellation shall be sent to the applicant and to
the owner of record. Costs of the cancellation procedure under this subsection
shall be borne by the nonprevailing party or parties, and the Administrator shall
have the authority to assess and collect such costs.
§1314 · Certification of registration
Certificates of registration shall be issued in the name of the United States under
the seal of the Office of the Administrator and shall be recorded in the official
records of the Office. The certificate shall state the name of the useful article, the
date of filing of the application, the date of registration, and the date the design
was made public, if earlier than the date of filing of the application, and shall contain
a reproduction of the drawing or other pictorial representation of the design.
If a description of the salient features of the design appears in the application, the
description shall also appear in the certificate. A certificate of registration shall be
admitted in any court as prima facie evidence of the facts stated in the certificate.
§1315 · Publication of announcements and indexes
(a) Publications of the Administrator.—The Administrator shall publish
lists and indexes of registered designs and cancellations of designs and may
also publish the drawings or other pictorial representations of registered designs
for sale or other distribution.
(b) File of Representatives of Registered Designs.—The Administrator
shall establish and maintain a file of the drawings or other pictorial representations
of registered designs. The file shall be available for use by the public
under such conditions as the Administrator may prescribe.
Copyright Law of the United States 275
Protection of Original Designs §1320
§1316 · Fees
The Administrator shall by regulation set reasonable fees for the filing of applications
to register designs under this chapter and for other services relating to
the administration of this chapter, taking into consideration the cost of providing
these services and the benefit of a public record.
§1317 · Regulations
The Administrator may establish regulations for the administration of this
chapter.
§1318 · Copies of records
Upon payment of the prescribed fee, any person may obtain a certified copy of
any official record of the Office of the Administrator that relates to this chapter.
That copy shall be admissible in evidence with the same effect as the original.
§1319 · Correction of errors in certificates
The Administrator may, by a certificate of correction under seal, correct any
error in a registration incurred through the fault of the Office, or, upon payment
of the required fee, any error of a clerical or typographical nature occurring in
good faith but not through the fault of the Office. Such registration, together
with the certificate, shall thereafter have the same effect as if it had been originally
issued in such corrected form.
§1320 · Ownership and transfer5
(a) Property Right in Design.—The property right in a design subject
to protection under this chapter shall vest in the designer, the legal representatives
of a deceased designer or of one under legal incapacity, the employer for
whom the designer created the design in the case of a design made within the
regular scope of the designer’s employment, or a person to whom the rights of
the designer or of such employer have been transferred. The person in whom the
property right is vested shall be considered the owner of the design.
(b) Transfer of Property Right.—The property right in a registered design,
or a design for which an application for registration has been or may be filed, 
276 Copyright Law of the United States
§1321 Protection of Original Designs
may be assigned, granted, conveyed, or mortgaged by an instrument in writing,
signed by the owner, or may be bequeathed by will.
(c) Oath or Acknowledgment of Transfer.—An oath or acknowledgment
under section 1312 shall be prima facie evidence of the execution of an
assignment, grant, conveyance, or mortgage under subsection (b).
(d) Recordation of Transfer.—An assignment, grant, conveyance, or
mortgage under subsection (b) shall be void as against any subsequent purchaser
or mortgagee for a valuable consideration, unless it is recorded in the Office of
the Administrator within 3 months after its date of execution or before the date
of such subsequent purchase or mortgage.
§1321 · Remedy for infringement
(a) In General.—The owner of a design is entitled, after issuance of a certificate
of registration of the design under this chapter, to institute an action for
any infringement of the design.
(b) Review of Refusal to Register.—(1) Subject to paragraph (2), the
owner of a design may seek judicial review of a final refusal of the Administrator
to register the design under this chapter by bringing a civil action, and may in
the same action, if the court adjudges the design subject to protection under this
chapter, enforce the rights in that design under this chapter.
(2) The owner of a design may seek judicial review under this section if—
(A) the owner has previously duly filed and prosecuted to final refusal
an application in proper form for registration of the design;
(B) the owner causes a copy of the complaint in the action to be delivered
to the Administrator within 10 days after the commencement of the
action; and
(C) the defendant has committed acts in respect to the design which
would constitute infringement with respect to a design protected under
this chapter.
(c) Administrator as Party to Action.—The Administrator may, at the
Administrator’s option, become a party to the action with respect to the issue of
registrability of the design claim by entering an appearance within 60 days after
being served with the complaint, but the failure of the Administrator to become
a party shall not deprive the court of jurisdiction to determine that issue.
(d) Use of Arbitration to Resolve Dispute.—The parties to an infringement
dispute under this chapter, within such time as may be specified by
the Administrator by regulation, may determine the dispute, or any aspect of the
dispute, by arbitration. Arbitration shall be governed by title 9. The parties shall
give notice of any arbitration award to the Administrator, and such award shall,
as between the parties to the arbitration, be dispositive of the issues to which it 
Copyright Law of the United States 277
Protection of Original Designs §1323
relates. The arbitration award shall be unenforceable until such notice is given.
Nothing in this subsection shall preclude the Administrator from determining
whether a design is subject to registration in a cancellation proceeding under
section 1313(c).
§1322 · Injunctions
(a) In General.—A court having jurisdiction over actions under this chapter
may grant injunctions in accordance with the principles of equity to prevent
infringement of a design under this chapter, including, in its discretion, prompt
relief by temporary restraining orders and preliminary injunctions.
(b) Damages for Injunctive Relief Wrongfully Obtained.—A seller
or distributor who suffers damage by reason of injunctive relief wrongfully obtained
under this section has a cause of action against the applicant for such
injunctive relief and may recover such relief as may be appropriate, including
damages for lost profits, cost of materials, loss of good will, and punitive damages
in instances where the injunctive relief was sought in bad faith, and, unless the
court finds extenuating circumstances, reasonable attorney’s fees.
§1323 · Recovery for infringement
(a) Damages.—Upon a finding for the claimant in an action for infringement
under this chapter, the court shall award the claimant damages adequate to compensate
for the infringement. In addition, the court may increase the damages to
such amount, not exceeding $50,000 or $1 per copy, whichever is greater, as the
court determines to be just. The damages awarded shall constitute compensation
and not a penalty. The court may receive expert testimony as an aid to the
determination of damages.
(b) Infringer’s Profits.—As an alternative to the remedies provided in
subsection (a), the court may award the claimant the infringer’s profits resulting
from the sale of the copies if the court finds that the infringer’s sales are reasonably
related to the use of the claimant’s design. In such a case, the claimant shall
be required to prove only the amount of the infringer’s sales and the infringer
shall be required to prove its expenses against such sales.
(c) Statute of Limitations.—No recovery under subsection (a) or (b) shall
be had for any infringement committed more than 3 years before the date on
which the complaint is filed.
(d) Attorney’s Fees.—In an action for infringement under this chapter,
the court may award reasonable attorney’s fees to the prevailing party.
278 Copyright Law of the United States
§1324 Protection of Original Designs

order that all infringing articles, and any plates, molds, patterns, models, or other
means specifically adapted for making the articles, be delivered up for destruction
or other disposition as the court may direct.
§1324 · Power of court over registration
In any action involving the protection of a design under this chapter, the
court, when appropriate, may order registration of a design under this chapter
or the cancellation of such a registration. Any such order shall be certified by
the court to the Administrator, who shall make an appropriate entry upon the
record.
§1325 · Liability for action on registration fraudulently obtained
Any person who brings an action for infringement knowing that registration of
the design was obtained by a false or fraudulent representation materially affecting
the rights under this chapter, shall be liable in the sum of $10,000, or such part of that
amount as the court may determine. That amount shall be to compensate the defendant
and shall be charged against the plaintiff and paid to the defendant, in addition
to such costs and attorney’s fees of the defendant as may be assessed by the court.
§1326 · Penalty for false marking
(a) In General.—Whoever, for the purpose of deceiving the public, marks
upon, applies to, or uses in advertising in connection with an article made, used,
distributed, or sold, a design which is not protected under this chapter, a design
notice specified in section 1306, or any other words or symbols importing that the
design is protected under this chapter, knowing that the design is not so protected,
shall pay a civil fine of not more than $500 for each such offense.
(b) Suit by Private Persons.—Any person may sue for the penalty established
by subsection (a), in which event one-half of the penalty shall be awarded
to the person suing and the remainder shall be awarded to the United States.

than $1,000, and any rights or privileges that individual may have in the design
under this chapter shall be forfeited.
§1328 · Enforcement by Treasury and Postal Service
(a) Regulations.—The Secretary of the Treasury and the United States
Postal Service shall separately or jointly issue regulations for the enforcement of
the rights set forth in section 1308 with respect to importation. Such regulations
may require, as a condition for the exclusion of articles from the United States,
that the person seeking exclusion take any one or more of the following actions:
(1) Obtain a court order enjoining, or an order of the International Trade
Commission under section 337 of the Tariff Act of 1930 excluding, importation
of the articles.
(2) Furnish proof that the design involved is protected under this chapter
and that the importation of the articles would infringe the rights in the design
under this chapter.
(3) Post a surety bond for any injury that may result if the detention or exclusion
of the articles proves to be unjustified.
(b) Seizure and Forfeiture.—Articles imported in violation of the rights
set forth in section 1308 are subject to seizure and forfeiture in the same manner
as property imported in violation of the customs laws. Any such forfeited articles
shall be destroyed as directed by the Secretary of the Treasury or the court, as the
case may be, except that the articles may be returned to the country of export
whenever it is shown to the satisfaction of the Secretary of the Treasury that the
importer had no reasonable grounds for believing that his or her acts constituted
a violation of the law.
§1329 · Relation to design patent law
The issuance of a design patent under title 35, United States Code, for an original
design for an article of manufacture shall terminate any protection of the
original design under this chapter.
§1330 · Common law and other rights unaffected
Nothing in this chapter shall annul or limit—
280 Copyright Law of the United States
§1332 Protection of Original Designs
(1) common law or other rights or remedies, if any, available to or held by
any person with respect to a design which has not been registered under this
chapter; or

been made public under section 1310(b) before the effective date of this chapter.6

of copyright ownership’ and ‘motion picture’ are defined in section 101 of
title 17) that is produced subject to 1 or more collective bargaining agreements
negotiated under the laws of the United States, if the transfer is executed on or
after the effective date of this chapter and is not limited to public performance
rights, the transfer instrument shall be deemed to incorporate the assumption
agreements applicable to the copyright ownership being transferred that are
required by the applicable collective bargaining agreement, and the transferee
shall be subject to the obligations under each such assumption agreement to 
290 Copyright Law of the United States
Appendix B The Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998
make residual payments and provide related notices, accruing after the effective
date of the transfer and applicable to the exploitation of the rights transferred,
and any remedies under each such assumption agreement for breach of those
obligations, as those obligations and remedies are set forth in the applicable
collective bargaining agreement, if—
‘‘(A) the transferee knows or has reason to know at the time of the transfer
that such collective bargaining agreement was or will be applicable to
the motion picture; or
‘‘(B) in the event of a court order confirming an arbitration award against
the transferor under the collective bargaining agreement, the transferor does
not have the financial ability to satisfy the award within 90 days after the
order is issued.

any of the following:
‘‘(A) Actual knowledge that the collective bargaining agreement was or
will be applicable to the motion picture.
‘‘(B)(i) Constructive knowledge that the collective bargaining agreement
was or will be applicable to the motion picture, arising from recordation of
a document pertaining to copyright in the motion picture under section
205 of title 17 or from publication, at a site available to the public online that
is operated by the relevant union, of information that identifies the motion
picture as subject to a collective bargaining agreement with that union, if
the site permits commercially reasonable verification of the date on which
the information was available for access.
‘‘(ii) Clause (i) applies only if the transfer referred to in subsection
(a)(1) occurs—
‘‘(I) after the motion picture is completed, or
‘‘(II) before the motion picture is completed and—
‘‘(aa) within 18 months before the filing of an application for copyright
registration for the motion picture under section 408 of title
17, or
‘‘(bb) if no such application is filed, within 18 months before the
first publication of the motion picture in the United States.
‘‘(C) Awareness of other facts and circumstances pertaining to a particular
transfer from which it is apparent that the collective bargaining agreement
was or will be applicable to the motion picture.

For purposes of this section, the exclusion under subsection (a) of transfers of
copyright ownership in a motion picture that are limited to public performance
rights includes transfers to a terrestrial broadcast station, cable system, or programmer

an exhibitor of the motion picture, either by exhibiting the motion picture on its

own network, system, service, or station, or by initiating the transmission of an
exhibition that is carried on another network, system, service, or station. When a
terrestrial broadcast station, cable system, or programmer, or other transferee, is
also functioning otherwise as a distributor or as a producer of the motion picture,
the public performance exclusion does not affect any obligations imposed on the
transferee to the extent that it is engaging in such functions.
‘‘(c) Exclusion for Grants of Security Interests.—Subsection (a) shall
not apply to—
‘‘(1) a transfer of copyright ownership consisting solely of a mortgage, hypothecation,
or other security interest; or
‘‘(2) a subsequent transfer of the copyright ownership secured by the security
interest described in paragraph (1) by or under the authority of the secured
party, including a transfer through the exercise of the secured party’s rights or
remedies as a secured party, or by a subsequent transferee.

law or contract.

on which obligations are imposed under subsection (a) by virtue of paragraph
(1) of that subsection may elect to defer performance of such obligations
that are subject to a bona fide dispute between a union and a prior transferor
until that dispute is resolved, except that such deferral shall not stay accrual of any
union claims due under an applicable collective bargaining agreement.
‘‘(e) Scope of Obligations Determined by Private Agreement.—Nothing
in this section shall expand or diminish the rights, obligations, or remedies of
any person under the collective bargaining agreements or assumption agreements
referred to in this section.
‘‘(f) Failure to Notify.—If the transferor under subsection (a) fails to notify
the transferee under subsection (a) of applicable collective bargaining obligations
before the execution of the transfer instrument, and subsection (a) is made applicable
to the transferee solely by virtue of subsection (a)(1)(B), the transferor
shall be liable to the transferee for any damages suffered by the transferee as a
result of the failure to notify.
‘‘(g) Determination of Disputes and Claims.—Any dispute concerning
the application of subsections (a) through (f) shall be determined by an action in
United States district court, and the court in its discretion may allow the recovery
of full costs by or against any party and may also award a reasonable attorney’s
fee to the prevailing party as part of the costs.

United States tax revenues;

a major source of creativity and innovation, business start-ups, skilled job
creation, exports, economic growth, and competitiveness;

revenue for United States companies each year and even greater losses to
the United States economy in terms of reduced job growth, exports, and
competitiveness;

and, increasingly, by foreign-based individuals and entities is a serious threat
to the long-term vitality of the United States economy and the future competitiveness
of United States industry;

to fund some of their activities;

commercial advantage or private financial gain;
(B) where the theft of intellectual property is central to the sustainability
and viability of the commercial activity of the enterprise (or subsidiary)
involved in the violation;
(C) where the counterfe ited or infringing goods or services enables the
enterprise to unfairly compete against the legitimate rights holder; or
(D) where there is actual knowledge of the theft of intellectual property

Article 35 · Relation to IPIC Treaty
Members agree to provide protection to the layout-designs (topographies) of
integrated circuits (hereinafter referred to as “layout-designs”) in accordance with
Articles 2–7 (other than paragraph 3 of Article 6), Article 12 and paragraph 3 of
Article 16 of the Treaty on Intellectual Property in Respect of Integrated Circuits
and, in addition, to comply with the following provisions.
Article 36 · Scope of the Protection
Subject to the provisions of paragraph 1 of Article 37 below, Members shall
consider unlawful the following acts if performed without the authorization of
the right holder:2 importing, selling, or otherwise distributing for commercial
purposes a protected layout-design, an integrated circuit in which a protected layout-design
is incorporated, or an article incorporating such an integrated circuit
only insofar as it continues to contain an unlawfully reproduced layout-design.
Article 37 · Acts Not Requiring the Authorization of the Right Holder3
1. Notwithstanding Article 36 above, no Member shall consider unlawful the
performance of any of the acts referred to in that Article in respect of an integrated
circuit incorporating an unlawfully reproduced layout-design or any
article incorporating such an integrated circuit where the person performing or
ordering such acts did not know and had no reasonable ground to know, when
acquiring the integrated circuit or article incorporating such an integrated circuit,
that it incorporated an unlawfully reproduced layout-design. Members shall
provide that, after the time that such person has received sufficient notice that
the layout-design was unlawfully reproduced, he may perform any of the acts
with respect to the stock on hand or ordered before such time, but shall be liable
to pay to the right holder a sum equivalent to a reasonable royalty such as would
be payable under a freely negotiated license in respect of such a layout-design.
2. The conditions set out in sub-paragraphs (a)–(k) of Article 31 above shall apply
mutatis mutandis in the event of any nonvoluntary licensing of a layout-design
or of its use by or for the government without the authorization of the right holder.

Act of 1998 deleted the definition of “Berne Convention work” from section
101.1 Pub. L. No. 105-304, 112 Stat. 2861. The definition of Berne Convention
work, as deleted, is as follows:
A work is a “Berne Convention work” if—
(1) in the case of an unpublished work, one or more of the authors is a
national of a nation adhering to the Berne Convention, or in the case of a
published work, one or more of the authors is a national of a nation adhering
to the Berne Convention on the date of first publication;
(2) the work was first published in a nation adhering to the Berne Convention,
or was simultaneously first published in a nation adhering to the
Berne convention and in a foreign nation that does not adhere to the Berne
Convention;
(3) in the case of an audiovisual work—
(A) if one or more of the authors is a legal entity, that author has its
headquarters in a nation adhering to the Berne Convention; or
(B) if one or more of the authors is an individual, that author is domiciled,
or has his or her habitual residence in, a nation adhering to the Berne
Convention; or
(4) in the case of a pictorial, graphic, or sculptural work that is incorporated
in a building or other structure, the building or structure is located in a nation
adhering to the Berne Convention; or
(5) in the case of an architectural work embodied in a building, such building
is erected in a country adhering to the Berne Convention.
For purposes of paragraph (1), an author who is domiciled in or has his or her
habitual residence in, a nation adhering to the Berne Convention is considered
to be a national of that nation. For purposes of paragraph (2), a work is considered
to have been simultaneously published in two or more nations if its dates
of publication are within 30 days of one another.
